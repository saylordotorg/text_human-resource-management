    <div class="section" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s00">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Training: Not Like It Used to Be</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s00_p01">Imagine this: You have a pile of work on your desk and as you get started, your Outlook calendar reminds you about a sexual harassment training in ten minutes. You groan to yourself, not looking forward to sitting in a conference room and seeing PowerPoint slide after PowerPoint slide. As you walk to the conference room, you run into a colleague who is taking the same training that day and commiserate on how boring this training is probably going to be. When you step into the conference room, however, you see something very different.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s00_p02">Computers are set up at every chair with a video ready to start on the computer. The HR manager greets you and asks you to take a seat. When the training starts, you are introduced (via video) on each of the computers to a series of sexual harassment example scenarios. The videos stop, and there is a recorded discussion about what the videos portrayed. Your colleagues in the Washington, DC, office are able to see the same training and, via video conferencing, are able to participate in the discussions. It is highly interactive and interesting. Once the training is finished, there are assignments to be completed via specific channels that have been set up for this training. You communicate about the material and complete the assignments in teams with members of your Washington, DC, office. If you want to review the material, you simply click on a review and the entire session or parts of the training can be reviewed. In fact, on your bus ride home from work, you access the channels on your iPhone, chatting with a colleague in your other office about the sexual harassment training assignment you have due next week. You receive an e-mail from your HR manager asking you to complete a training assessment located in a specific channel in the software, and you happily comply because you have an entirely new perspective on what training can be.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s00_p03">This is the training of today. No longer do people sit in hot, stuffy rooms to get training on boring content. Training has become highly interactive, technical, and interesting owing to the amount of multimedia we can use. Sun Microsystems, for example, has developed just the kind of software mentioned above, called Social Learning eXchange (SLX). This type of training allows people across the country to connect with each other, saving both money and time. In fact, Sun Microsystems received a Best Practices Award from <em class="emphasis">Training Magazine</em> for this innovative software in 2010.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn08_001">“2010 Top 25 Winners,” <em class="emphasis">Training Magazine</em>, accessed July 25, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.trainingmag.com/article/2010-top-125-winners">http://www.trainingmag.com/article/2010-top-125-winners</a>.</span> The SLX software allows training to be delivered in an interactive manner in multiple locations. The implications of this type of software are numerous. For example, SLX is used at Sun Professional Services division by delivering instructional videos on tools and software, which employees can view at their own pace.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn08_002">“Video Community for the Enterprise,” <em class="emphasis">Social Learning eXchange</em>, accessed July 25, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.slideshare.net/sociallearningexchange/social-learning-exchange-slx?from=share_email">http://www.slideshare.net/sociallearningexchange/social-learning-exchange-slx?from=share_email</a>.</span> There is also a channel in the software that allows the vice president to communicate with employees on a regular basis to improve employee communications. In another example, this software can be used to quickly communicate product changes to the sales team, who then begin the process of positioning their products to consumers. Training videos, including breakout sessions, can save companies money by not requiring travel to a session. These can even be accessed using application technology on cell phones. Employees can obtain the training they need in the comfort of their own city, office, or home. Someone is sick the day the training is delivered? No problem; they can review the recorded training sessions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s00_p04">An estimated $1,400 per employee is spent on training annually, with training costs consuming 2.72 percent of the total payroll budget<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn08_003">See the American Society for Training and Development Trend Review, <em class="emphasis">ASTD Website</em>, accessed July 25, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.astd.org/">http://www.astd.org/</a>.</span> for the average company. With such a large amount of funds at stake, HR managers must develop the right training programs to meet the needs; otherwise, these funds are virtually wasted. This chapter is all about how to assess, develop, implement, and measure an effective training program.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s01_p01">Any effective company has training in place to make sure employees can perform his or her job. During the recruitment and selection process, the right person should be hired to begin with. But even the right person may need training in how your company does things. Lack of training can result in lost productivity, lost customers, and poor relationships between employees and managers. It can also result in dissatisfaction, which means retention problems and high turnover. All these end up being direct costs to the organization. In fact, a study performed by the American Society for Training and Development (ASTD) found that 41 percent of employees at companies with poor training planned to leave within the year, but in companies with excellent training, only 12 percent planned to leave.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn08_004">Leigh Branham, <em class="emphasis">The 7 Hidden Reasons Why Employees Leave</em> (New York: American Management Association, 2005), 112–5.</span> To reduce some costs associated with not training or undertraining, development of training programs can help with some of the risk. This is what this chapter will address.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s01_p02">For effective employee training, there are four steps that generally occur. First, the new employee goes through an orientation, and then he or she will receive in-house training on job-specific areas. Next, the employee should be assigned a mentor, and then, as comfort with the job duties grows, he or she may engage in external training. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Employee training and development</a><span class="glossdef">The framework used to help employees develop their personal and organizational skills, knowledge, and abilities.</span></span> is the process of helping employees develop their personal and organization skills, knowledge, and abilities.</p>
    <div class="section" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Employee Orientation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_p01">The first step in training is an employee orientation. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Employee orientation</a><span class="glossdef">The process used for welcoming a new employee into the organization.</span></span> is the process used for welcoming a new employee into the organization. The importance of employee orientation is two-fold. First, the goal is for employees to gain an understanding of the company policies and learn how their specific job fits into the big picture. Employee orientation usually involves filling out employee paperwork such as I-9 and 401(k) program forms.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_p02">The goals of an orientation are as follows:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">To reduce start-up costs.</strong> If an orientation is done right, it can help get the employee up to speed on various policies and procedures, so the employee can start working right away. It can also be a way to ensure all hiring paperwork is filled out correctly, so the employee is paid on time.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">To reduce anxiety.</strong> Starting a new job can be stressful. One goal of an orientation is to reduce the stress and anxiety people feel when going into an unknown situation.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">To reduce employee turnover.</strong> Employee turnover tends to be higher when employees don’t feel valued or are not given the tools to perform. An employee orientation can show that the organization values the employee and provides tools necessary for a successful entry.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">To save time for the supervisor and coworkers.</strong> A well-done orientation makes for a better prepared employee, which means less time having to teach the employee.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">To set expectations and attitudes.</strong> If employees know from the start what the expectations are, they tend to perform better. Likewise, if employees learn the values and attitudes of the organization from the beginning, there is a higher chance of a successful tenure at the company.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_p03">Some companies use employee orientation as a way to introduce employees not only to the company policies and procedures but also to the staff. For an example of an orientation schedule for the day, see <a class="xref" href="#portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_f01">Figure 8.1</a>.</p>

            <p class="para">Some companies have very specific orientations, with a variety of people providing information to the new hires. This can create a welcoming environment, besides giving the employee the information they need. This is an example of one such orientation.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">In-House Training</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">In-house training programs</a><span class="glossdef">Learning opportunities developed by the organization in which they are used.</span></span> are learning opportunities developed by the organization in which they are used. This is usually the second step in the training process and often is ongoing. In-house training programs can be training related to a specific job, such as how to use a particular kind of software. In a manufacturing setting, in-house training might include an employee learning how to use a particular kind of machinery.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_p02">Many companies provide in-house training on various HR topics as well, meaning it doesn’t always have to relate to a specific job. Some examples of in-house training include the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_l01">
            <li>Ethics training</li>
            <li>Sexual harassment training</li>
            <li>Multicultural training</li>
            <li>Communication training</li>
            <li>Management training</li>
            <li>Customer service training</li>
            <li>Operation of special equipment</li>
            <li>Training to do the job itself</li>
            <li>Basic skills training</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s01_s02_p03">As you can tell by the list of topics, HR might sometimes create and deliver this training, but often a supervisor or manager delivers the training.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s01_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Mentoring</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_p01">After the employee has completed orientation and in-house training, companies see the value in offering mentoring opportunities as the next step in training. Sometimes a mentor may be assigned during in-house training. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mentor</a><span class="glossdef">A trusted and experienced advisor who has direct investment in the development of an employee.</span></span> is a trusted, experienced advisor who has direct investment in the development of an employee. A mentor may be a supervisor, but often a mentor is a colleague who has the experience and personality to help guide someone through processes. While mentoring may occur informally, a mentorship program can help ensure the new employee not only feels welcomed but is paired up with someone who already knows the ropes and can help guide the new employee through any on-the-job challenges.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_p02">To work effectively, a mentoring program should become part of the company culture; in other words, new mentors should receive in-house training to be a mentor. Mentors are selected based on experience, willingness, and personality. IBM’s Integrated Supply Chain Division, for example, has successfully implemented a mentorship program. The company’s division boasts 19,000 employees and half of IBM’s revenues, making management of a mentorship program challenging. However, potential mentors are trained and put into a database where new employees can search attributes and strengths of mentors and choose the person who closely meets their needs. Then the mentor and mentee work together in development of the new employee. “We view this as a best practice,” says Patricia Lewis-Burton, vice president of human resources, Integrated Supply Chain Division. “We view it as something that is not left to human resources alone. In fact, the program is imbedded in the way our group does business.”<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn08_005">Blyde Witt, “Serious Leadership: IBM Builds a Successful Mentoring Program,” <em class="emphasis">Material Handling Management</em>, December 1, 2005, accessed July 25, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://mhmonline.com/workforce-solutions/mhm_imp_4483/">http://mhmonline.com/workforce-solutions/mhm_imp_4483/</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_p03">Some companies use short-term mentorship programs because they find employees training other employees to be valuable for all involved. Starbucks, for example, utilizes this approach. When it opens a new store in a new market, a team of experienced store managers and baristas are sent from existing stores to the new stores to lead the store-opening efforts, including training of new employees.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn08_006">Arthur Thompson, “Starbucks Corporation,” July 24, 2011, accessed July 29, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mhhe.com/business/management/thompson/11e/case/starbucks-2.html">http://www.mhhe.com/business/management/thompson/11e/case/starbucks-2.html</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s02_s08_p03">Towanda Michaels is the human resource manager at a medium-size pet supply wholesaler. Casey Cleps is a salesperson at the organization and an invaluable member of the team. Last year, his sales brought in about 20 percent of the company revenue alone.

            <p class="para editable" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s02_s08_p04">Training is an important part of the company, and an e-mail was sent last month that said if employees do not complete the required safety training by July 1, they would be let go.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s02_p01">There are a number of different types of training we can use to engage an employee. These types are usually used in all steps in a training process (orientation, in-house, mentorship, and external training). The training utilized depends on the amount of resources available for training, the type of company, and the priority the company places on training. Companies such as The Cheesecake Factory, a family restaurant, make training a high priority. The company spends an average of $2,000 per hourly employee. This includes everyone from the dishwasher and managers to the servers. For The Cheesecake Factory, this expenditure has paid off.

In a retail environment, technical training might include teaching someone how to use the computer system to ring up customers. In a sales position, it might include showing someone how to use the customer relationship management (CRM) system to find new prospects. In a consulting business, technical training might be used so the consultant knows how to use the system to input the number of hours that should be charged to a client. In a restaurant, the server needs to be trained on how to use the system to process orders. Let’s assume your company has decided to switch to the newest version of Microsoft Office. This might require some technical training of the entire company to ensure everyone uses the technology effectively. Technical training is often performed in-house, but it can also be administrered externally.</p>

In a world where quality can set your business apart from competitors, this type of training provides employees with the knowledge to recognize products that are not up to quality standards and teaches them what to do in this scenario. Numerous organizations, such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), measure quality based on a number of metrics. This organization provides the stamp of quality approval for companies producing tangible products. ISO has developed quality standards for almost every field imaginable, not only considering product quality but also certifying companies in environmental management quality. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ISO9000</a><span class="glossdef">The set of standards for quality management.</span></span> is the set of standards for quality management, while <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ISO14000</a><span class="glossdef">The set of standards for environmental management.</span></span> is the set of standards for environmental management.

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_p02">Training employees on quality standards, including ISO standards, can give them a competitive advantage.

The trainer could be HR or management or even another employee showing a new technical skill. Brown bag lunches can also be an effective way to perform team training, as it brings people together in a more relaxed atmosphere. Some companies offer brown bag lunch training for personal development as well. For example, HR might want to bring in a specialist on 401(k) plans, or perhaps an employee provides a slide presentation on a trip he or she has taken, discussing the things learned on the trip. One disadvantage to this type of training can be low attendance and garnering enough interest from employees who may not want to “work” during lunch breaks. There can also be inconsistency in messages if training is delivered and not everyone is present to hear the message.</p>

There are several advantages to web-based training. First, it is available on demand, does not require travel, and can be cost efficient. However, disadvantages might include an impersonal aspect to the training and limited bandwidth or technology capabilities.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn08_017">“Advantages and Disadvantages,” Web Based Training Information Center, accessed July 27, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.webbasedtraining.com/primer_advdis.aspx">http://www.webbasedtraining.com/primer_advdis.aspx</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s03_s04_p02">Web-based training delivery lends itself well to certain training topics. For example, this might be an appropriate delivery method for safety training, technical training, quality training, and professional training. However, for some training, such as soft-skills training, job skills training, managerial training, and team training, another more personalized method may be better for delivery. However, there are many different platforms that lend themselves to an interactive approach to training, such as Sun Microsystems’ Social Learning eXchange (SLX) training system, which has real-time video and recording capabilities. Hundreds of platforms are available to facilitate web-based training. DigitalChalk, for example, allows for both synchronous and asynchronous training and allows the instructor or human relations manager to track training progress and completion.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn08_018">DigitalChalk website, accessed August 12, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.digitalchalk.com/">http://www.digitalchalk.com/</a>.</span> Some companies use SharePoint, an intranet platform, to store training videos and materials.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn08_019">Microsoft’s SharePoint website, accessed August 12, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx">http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx</a>.</span> Blackboard and Angel (used primarily by higher education institutions) allows human resource managers to create training modules, which can be moderated by a facilitator or managed in a self-paced format. In any of the platforms available, media such as video and podcasts can be included within the training.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s03_s04_p03">Considerations for selecting a web-based platform include the following:</p>

            <li>Is there a one-time fee or a per-user fee?</li>

For example, an apprentice electrician would shadow and watch the journeyman electrician perform the skills and tasks and learn by watching. Eventually, the apprentice would be able to learn the skills to do the job alone. The downside to this type of training is the possibility that the person job shadowing may learn “bad habits” or shortcuts to performing tasks that may not be beneficial to the organization.</p>

In Orlando at Disneyworld, most of this training takes place at Disney University. Disney University provides training to its 42,000 cast members (this is what Disney calls employees) in areas such as culinary arts, computer applications, and specific job components. Once hired, all cast members go through a two-day Disney training program called Traditions, where they learn the basics of being a good cast member and the history of the company. For all practical purposes, Traditions is a new employee orientation.</p>

While all positions receive extensive training, one of the most extensive trainings are especially for Disney characters, since their presence at the theme parks is a major part of the customer experience. To become a character cast member, a character performer audition is required. The auditions require dancing and acting, and once hired, the individual is given the job of several characters to play. After a two-week intensive training process on character history, personalities, and ability to sign the names of the characters (for the autograph books sold at the parks for kids), an exam is given. The exam tests competency in character understanding, and passing the exam is required to become hired.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn08_020">Jim Hill, “Blood, Sweat, and Fur,” <em class="emphasis">Jim Hill Media</em>, May 2005, accessed July 30, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://jimhillmedia.com/guest_writers1/b/rob_bloom/archive/2005/05/03/1703.aspx">http://jimhillmedia.com/guest_writers1/b/rob_bloom/archive/2005/05/03/1703.aspx</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s01_p05">There are also types of training that will likely be required for a job, such as technical training, safety training, quality training, and professional training. Each of these should be viewed as separate training programs, requiring an individual framework for each type of training. For example, an employee orientation framework will look entirely different from an in-house technical training framework.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s01_p06">Training must be tied to job expectations. Any and all training developed should transfer directly to the skills of that particular employee. Reviewing the HR strategic plan and various job analyses may help you see what kind of training should be developed for specific job titles in your organization.</p>

For our purposes, we will utilize a widely accepted learning style model. Recent research has shown that classifying people into learning styles may not be the best way to determine a style, and most people have a different style depending on the information being taught. In a study by Pashler et al.,<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn08_025">Harold Pashler, Mark McDaniel, Doug Rohrer, and Robert Bjork, “Learning Styles: Concepts and Evidence,” <em class="emphasis">Psychological Science in the Public Interest</em> 9, no. 3 (2008): 109–19, accessed February 26, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.psychologicalscience.org/journals/pspi/PSPI_9_3.pdf">http://www.psychologicalscience.org/journals/pspi/PSPI_9_3.pdf</a>.</span> the authors look at aptitude and personality as key traits when learning, as opposed to classifying people into categories of learning styles. Bearing this in mind, we will address a common approach to learning styles next.</p>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Visual learner.</strong> A visual learner usually has a clear “picture” of an experience. A visual learner often says things such as “I can see what you are saying” or “This looks good.” A visual learner is best reached using graphics, pictures, and figures.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Auditory learner.</strong> An auditory learner learns by sound. An auditory learner might say, “If I hear you right” or “What do you hear about this situation?” The auditory learner will learn by listening to a lecture or to someone explaining how to do something.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Kinesthetic learner.</strong> A kinesthetic learner learns by developing feelings toward an experience.

            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s05_p01">How much money do you think the training will cost? The type of training performed will depend greatly on the budget. If you decide that web-based training is the right delivery mode, but you don’t have the budget to pay the user fee for the platform, this wouldn’t be the best option. Besides the actual cost of training, another cost consideration is people’s time. If employees are in training for two hours, what is the cost to the organization while they are not able to perform their job? A spreadsheet should be developed that lists the actual cost for materials, snacks, and other direct costs, but also the indirect costs, such as people’s time.</p>

It’s also important to keep in mind that most people don’t learn through “death by PowerPoint”; they learn in a variety of ways, such as auditory, kinesthetic, or visual. Considering this, what kinds of ice breakers, breakout discussions, and activities can you incorporate to make the training as interactive as possible? Role plays and other games can make the training fun for employees. Many trainers implement online videos, podcasts, and other interactive media in their training sessions. This ensures different learning styles are met and also makes the training more interesting.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s07_p01">Considering your audience is an important aspect to training. How long have they been with the organization, or are they new employees? What departments do they work in? Knowing the answers to these questions can help you develop a relevant delivery style that makes for better training. For example, if you know that all the people attending the training are from the accounting department, examples you provide in the training can be focused on this type of job. If you have a mixed group, examples and discussions can touch on a variety of disciplines.</p>

Development of learning objectives or those things you want your learners to know after the training makes for a more focused training. Think of learning objectives as goals—what should someone know after completing this training? Here are some sample learning objectives:</p>

                <li>Be able to define and explain the handling of hazardous materials in the workplace.</li>
                <li>Be able to utilize the team decision process model.</li>
                <li>Understand the definition of sexual harassment and be able to recognize sexual harassment in the workplace.</li>
                <li>Understand and be able to explain the company policies and structure.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s08_p02">After you have developed the objectives and goals, you can begin to develop the content of the training.

            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s08_p03">Development of content usually requires a development of learning objectives and then a brief outline of the major topics you wish to cover. With that outline, you can “fill in” the major topics with information. Based on this information, you can develop modules or PowerPoint slides, activities, discussion questions, and other learning techniques.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s09_p01">For some types of training, time lines may be required to ensure the training has been done. This is often the case for safety training; usually the training should be done before the employee starts. In other words, in what time frame should an employee complete the training?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s09_p02">Another consideration regarding time lines is how much time you think you need to give the training. Perhaps one hour will be enough, but sometimes, training may take a day or even a week. After you have developed your training content, you will likely have a good idea as to how long it will take to deliver it. Consider the fact that most people do not have a lot of time for training and keep the training time realistic and concise.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s09_p03">From a long-term approach, it may not be cost effective to offer an orientation each time someone new is hired. One consideration might be to offer orientation training once per month so that all employees hired within that month are trained at the same time.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s09_p04">Development of a dependable schedule for training might be ideal, as in the following example:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s09_l01">
                <li>Orientation is offered on the first Thursday of every month.</li>
                <li>The second and third Tuesday will consist of vestibule training on management skills and communication.</li>
                <li>Twice yearly, in August and March, safety and sexual harassment training will be given to meet the legal company requirements.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s09_p05">Developing a dependable training schedule allows for better communication to your staff, results in fewer communication issues surrounding training, and allows all employees to plan ahead to attend training.</p>

        <div class="section" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s10">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Communication</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s10_p01">Once you have developed your training, your next consideration is how you will communicate the available training to employees. In a situation such as an orientation, you will need to communicate to managers, staff, and anyone involved in the training the timing and confirm that it fits within their schedule. If it is an informal training, such as a brown bag lunch on 401(k) plans, this might involve determining the days and times that most people are in the office and might be able to participate. Because employees use Mondays and Fridays, respectively, to catch up and finish up work for the week, these days tend to be the worst for training.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s10_p02">Consider utilizing your company’s intranet, e-mail, and even old-fashioned posters to communicate the training. Many companies have Listservs that can relay the message to only certain groups, if need be.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s11_p01">After we have completed the training, we want to make sure our training objectives were met. One model to measure effectiveness of training is the Kirkpatrick model,<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn08_028">Donald Kirkpatrick, <em class="emphasis">Evaluating Training Programs</em>, 3rd ed. (San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler, 2006).</span> developed in the 1950s. His model has four levels:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s11_l01">
                <li>Reaction: How did the participants react to the training program?</li>
                <li>Learning: To what extent did participants improve knowledge and skills?</li>
                <li>Behavior: Did behavior change as a result of the training?</li>
                <li>Results: What benefits to the organization resulted from the training?</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s11_p02">Each of Kirkpatrick’s levels can be assessed using a variety of methods. We will discuss those next.</p>
            <div class="figure large editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s11_f01">

            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s11_p03">Review the performance of the employees who received the training, and if possible review the performance of those who did not receive the training. For example, in your orientation training, if one of the learning objectives was to be able to request time off using the company intranet, and several employees who attended the training come back and ask for clarification on how to perform this task, it may mean the training didn’t work as well as you might have thought. In this case, it is important to go back and review the learning objectives and content of your training to ensure it can be more effective in the future.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s11_p04">Many trainers also ask people to take informal, anonymous surveys after the training to gauge the training. These types of surveys can be developed quickly and easily through websites such as SurveyMonkey. Another option is to require a quiz at the end of the training to see how well the employees understand what you were trying to teach them. The quiz should be developed based on the learning objective you set for the training. For example, if a learning objective was to be able to follow OSHA standards, then a quiz might be developed specifically related to those standards. There are a number of online tools, some free, to develop quizzes and send them to people attending your training. For example, Wondershare QuizCreator<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn08_029">WonderShare QuizCreator, accessed July 29, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sameshow.com/quiz-creator.html#172">http://www.sameshow.com/quiz-creator.html#172</a>.</span> offers a free trial and enables the manager to track who took the quiz and how well they did. Once developed by the trainer, the quiz can be e-mailed to each participant and the manager can see how each trainee did on the final quiz. After you see how participants do on the quiz, you can modify the training for next time to highlight areas where participants needed improvement.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s11_p05">It can be easy to forget about this step in the training process because usually we are so involved with the next task: we forget to ask questions about how something went and then take steps to improve it.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s11_p06">One way to improve effectiveness of a training program is to offer rewards when employees meet training goals. For example, if budget allows, a person might receive a pay increase or other reward for each level of training completed.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p02">Career development programs are necessary in today’s organizations for a variety of reasons. First, with a maturing baby-boom population, newer employees must be trained to take those jobs once baby boomers retire. Second, if an employee knows a particular path to career development is in place, this can increase motivation. A career development plan usually includes a list of short- and long-term goals that employees have pertaining to their current and future jobs and a planned sequence of formal and informal training and experiences needed to help them reach the goals. As this chapter has discussed, the organization can and should be instrumental in defining what types of training, both in-house and external, can be used to help develop employees.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p03">To help develop this type of program, managers can consider a few components:<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn08_030">Martha Heller, “Six Tips for Effective Employee Development Programs,” <em class="emphasis">CIO Magazine</em>, June 15, 2005, accessed July 28, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cio.com/article/29169/Six_Tips_for_Effective_Career_Development_Programs">http://www.cio.com/article/29169/Six_Tips_for_Effective_Career_Development_Programs</a>.</span></p>

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Talk to employees.</strong> Although this may seem obvious, it doesn’t always happen. Talking with employees about their goals and what they hope to achieve can be a good first step in developing a formal career development program.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Create specific requirements for career development.</strong> Allow employees to see that if they do A, B, and C, they will be eligible for promotion. For example, to become a supervisor, maybe three years of experience, management training, and communication training are required. Perhaps an employee might be required to prove themselves in certain areas, such as “maintain and exceed sales quota for eight quarters” to be a sales manager. In other words, in career development there should be a clear process for the employees to develop themselves within the organization.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use cross-training and job rotation.</strong> Cross-training is a method by which employees can gain management experience, even if for short periods of time. For example, when a manager is out of the office, putting an employee “in charge” can help the employee learn skills and abilities needed to perform that function appropriately. Through the use of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">job rotation</a><span class="glossdef">Involves a systematic movement of employees from job to job within an organization.</span></span>, which involves a systematic movement of employees from job to job within an organization, employees can gain a variety of experiences to prepare them for upward movement in the organization.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Utilize mentors.</strong> Mentorship can be a great way for employees to understand what it takes to develop one’s career to the next level. A formal mentorship program in place with willing mentees can add value to your career development program.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p04">There are many tools on the web, including templates to help employees develop their own career development plans. Many organizations, in fact, ask employees to develop their own plans and use those as a starting point for understanding long-term career goals. Then hopefully the organization can provide them with the opportunities to meet these career goals. In the late 1980s, many employees felt that career opportunities at their current organizations dwindled after seeing the downsizing that occurred. It gave employees the feeling that companies were not going to help develop them, unless they took the initiative to do so themselves. Unfortunately, this attitude means that workers will not wait for career opportunities within the company, unless a clear plan and guide is put into place by the company.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn08_031">Peter Capelli, “A Balanced Plan for Career Development,” n.d., Microsoft, accessed July 29, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/a-balanced-plan-for-career-development-HA001126815.aspx">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/a-balanced-plan-for-career-development-HA001126815.aspx</a>.</span> Here is an example of a process that can be used to put a career development program in place:<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn08_032">Jose Trueba Adolfo, “The Career Development Plan: A Quick Guide for Managers and Supervisors,” n.d., National Career Development Association, accessed July 29, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://associationdatabase.com/aws/NCDA/pt/sd/news_article/6420/_PARENT/layout_details/false">http://associationdatabase.com/aws/NCDA/pt/sd/news_article/6420/_PARENT/layout_details/false</a>.</span></p>

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_l03">
                <li>There are a number of key considerations in developing a training program. Training should not be handled casually but instead developed specifically to meet the needs of the organization. This can be done by a needs assessment consisting of three levels: <em class="emphasis">organizational</em>, <em class="emphasis">occupational</em>, and <em class="emphasis">individual assessments</em>.</li>
                <li>The first consideration is the delivery mode; depending on the type of training and other factors, some modes might be better than others.</li>
                <li>Budget is a consideration in developing training. The cost of materials, but also the cost of time, should be considered.</li>
                <li>The delivery style must take into account people’s individual learning styles. The amount of lecture, discussion, role plays, and activities are considered part of delivery style.</li>
                <li>The audience for the training is an important aspect when developing training. This can allow the training to be better developed to meet the needs and the skills of a particular group of people.</li>
                <li>The content obviously is an important consideration. Learning objectives and goals for the training should be developed before content is developed.</li>
                <li>After content is developed, understanding the time constraints is an important aspect. Will the training take one hour or a day to deliver? What is the time line consideration in terms of when people should take the training?</li>
                <li>Letting people know when and where the training will take place is part of communication.</li>
                <li>The final aspect of developing a training framework is to consider how it will be measured. At the end, how will you know if the trainees learned what they needed to learn?</li>
                <li>A career development process can help retain good employees. It involves creating a specific program in which employee goals are identified and new training and opportunities are identified and created to help the employee in the career development process.</li>

        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s05_l01">
            <li>Employee training and development is a necessity in today’s work environment. Training and development can lead to lower turnover and increased motivation.</li>
            <li>There are four basic steps to employee training: employee orientation, in-house training, mentoring, and external training.</li>
            <li>Different types of training can be delivered, each falling into the steps of employee training. These include technical or technology training, quality training, skills training, soft skills training, professional training, team training, managerial training, and safety training.</li>
            <li>Within the types of training, we need to determine which method is best for the actual delivery of training. Options include on-the-job training, mentor training, brown bag lunches, web-based training, job shadowing, job swapping, and vestibule training.</li>
            <li>Development of a training development framework is the first step in solidifying the training.</li>
            <li>Considerations and steps to developing the training framework include determining the training needs, delivery modes, budget, delivery style, audience, content, time lines, communication of the training, and measurement of the training.</li>
            <li>Career development programs can be an essential piece to the training puzzle. A comprehensive program or plan, either developed by employees or administered by HR, can help with motivation and fill the gap when people in the organization leave or retire. It can also be used as a motivational tool.</li>

        <p class="simpara">New on the Job</p>
        <p class="para" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s05_p01">JoAnn Michaels just started her job as human resources manager at In the Dog House, a retail chain specializing in dog apparel and accessories. She is a good friend of yours you met in college.</p>
        <p class="para" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s05_p02">The organization has 35 stores with 250 employees in Washington, Idaho, and Oregon. As the chain has grown, the training programs have been conducted somewhat piecemeal. Upon visiting some of the stores in a three-week tour, JoAnn has realized that all the stores seem to have different ways of training their in-store employees.</p>
        <p class="para" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s05_p03">When she digs further, she realizes even the corporate offices, which employ seventy-five people, have no formal training program. In the past, they have done informal and optional brown bag lunch training to keep employees up to date. As a result, JoAnn develops a survey using SurveyMonkey and sends it to all seventy-five corporate employees. She created a rating system, with 1 meaning strongly disagree and 5 meaning strongly agree. Employees were not required to answer all questions, hence the variation in the number of responses column. After this task, JoAnn creates a slightly different survey and sends it to all store managers, asking them to encourage their retail employees to take the survey. The results are shown here.</p>
