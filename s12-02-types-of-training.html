    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s02_p01">There are a number of different types of training we can use to engage an employee. These types are usually used in all steps in a training process (orientation, in-house, mentorship, and external training). The training utilized depends on the amount of resources available for training, the type of company, and the priority the company places on training. Companies such as The Cheesecake Factory, a family restaurant, make training a high priority. The company spends an average of $2,000 per hourly employee. This includes everyone from the dishwasher and managers to the servers. For The Cheesecake Factory, this expenditure has paid off. They measure the effectiveness of its training by looking at turnover, which is 15 percent below the industry average.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn08_008">Gina Ruiz, “Cheesecake Factory Cooks Up a Rigorous Employee Training Program,” <em class="emphasis">Workforce Management</em>, April 24, 2006, accessed July 25, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.workforce.com/section/11/feature/24/35/18/">http://www.workforce.com/section/11/feature/24/35/18/</a>.</span> Servers make up 40 percent of the workforce and spend two weeks training to obtain certification.

    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s02_p02">As you will see from the types of training below, no one type would be enough for the jobs we do. Most HR managers use a variety of these types of training to develop a holistic employee.</p>
    <div class="section" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Technical or Technology Training</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_p01">Depending on the type of job, technical training will be required. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Technical training</a><span class="glossdef">A type of training meant to teach new employees the technological aspects of their job.</span></span> is a type of training meant to teach the new employee the technological aspects of the job. In a retail environment, technical training might include teaching someone how to use the computer system to ring up customers. In a sales position, it might include showing someone how to use the customer relationship management (CRM) system to find new prospects. In a consulting business, technical training might be used so the consultant knows how to use the system to input the number of hours that should be charged to a client. In a restaurant, the server needs to be trained on how to use the system to process orders. Let’s assume your company has decided to switch to the newest version of Microsoft Office. This might require some technical training of the entire company to ensure everyone uses the technology effectively. Technical training is often performed in-house, but it can also be administrered externally.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Quality Training</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_p01">In a production-focused business, quality training is extremely important. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Quality training</a><span class="glossdef">Refers to familiarizing all employees with the means for preventing, detecting, and eliminating nonquality items.</span></span> refers to familiarizing employees with the means of preventing, detecting, and eliminating nonquality items, usually in an organization that produces a product. In a world where quality can set your business apart from competitors, this type of training provides employees with the knowledge to recognize products that are not up to quality standards and teaches them what to do in this scenario. Numerous organizations, such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), measure quality based on a number of metrics. This organization provides the stamp of quality approval for companies producing tangible products. ISO has developed quality standards for almost every field imaginable, not only considering product quality but also certifying companies in environmental management quality. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ISO9000</a><span class="glossdef">The set of standards for quality management.</span></span> is the set of standards for quality management, while <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ISO14000</a><span class="glossdef">The set of standards for environmental management.</span></span> is the set of standards for environmental management. ISO has developed 18,000 standards over the last 60 years.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn08_010">“The ISO Story,” International Organization for Standards, accessed July 26, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.iso.org/iso/about/the_iso_story/iso_story_early_years.htm">http://www.iso.org/iso/about/the_iso_story/iso_story_early_years.htm</a>.</span> With the increase in globalization, these international quality standards are more important than ever for business development. Some companies, like 3M,<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn08_011">QAI website, accessed July 30, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.trainingforquality.com/Content.aspx?id=26">http://www.trainingforquality.com/Content.aspx?id=26</a>.</span> choose to offer ISO training as external online training, employing companies such as QAI to deliver the training both online and in classrooms to employees.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_p02">Training employees on quality standards, including ISO standards, can give them a competitive advantage. It can result in cost savings in production as well as provide an edge in marketing of the quality-controlled products. Some quality training can happen in-house, but organizations such as ISO also perform external training.</p>

For example, an administrative assistant might be trained in how to answer the phone, while a salesperson at Best Buy might be trained in assessment of customer needs and on how to offer the customer information to make a buying decision. Think of skills training as the things you actually need to know to perform your job. A cashier needs to know not only the technology to ring someone up but what to do if something is priced wrong. Most of the time, skills training is given in-house and can include the use of a mentor. An example of a type of skills training is from AT&amp;T and Apple,<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn08_012">Lance Whitney, “Apple, AT&amp;T Reportedly Prepping Staff for iPhone 5 Launch,” <em class="emphasis">CNET</em>, July 26, 2011, accessed July 29, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-20083435-37/apple-at-t-reportedly-prepping-staff-for-iphone-5-launch/">http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-20083435-37/apple-at-t-reportedly-prepping-staff-for-iphone-5-launch/</a>.</span> who in summer 2011 asked their managers to accelerate retail employee training on the iPhone 5, which was released to market in the fall.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s02_s04_p02">In a retail or restaurant environment, soft skills are used in every interaction with customers and are a key component of the customer experience. In fact, according to a <em class="emphasis">Computerworld</em> magazine survey, executives say there is an increasing need for people who have not only the skills and technical skills to do a job but also the necessary soft skills, such as strong listening and communication abilities.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn08_013">Thomas Hoffman, “Nine Nontechie Skills That Hiring Managers Wish You Had,” <em class="emphasis">Computerworld</em>, November 12, 2007, accessed July 26, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/305966/Are_You_the_Complete_Package_">http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/305966/Are_You_the_Complete_Package_</a>.</span> Many problems in organizations are due to a lack of soft skills, or interpersonal skills, not by problems with the business itself.

The goal of team training is to develop cohesiveness among team members, allowing them to get to know each other and facilitate relationship building.

        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s02_s06_l01">
