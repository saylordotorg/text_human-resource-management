Stress management, office-related injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome, and no-fragrance areas are all contemporary issues surrounding employee health and safety.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Stress</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_p01">In its annual survey on stress in America,<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn13_011">American Psychological Association, “Key Findings,” news release, n.d., accessed April 17, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/key-findings.aspx">http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/key-findings.aspx</a>.</span> the American Psychological Association found that money (76 percent), work (70 percent), and the economy (65 percent) remain the most oft-cited sources of stress for Americans. Job instability is on the rise as a source of stress: nearly half (49 percent) of adults reported that job instability was a source of stress in 2010 (compared to 44 percent in 2009). At the same time, fewer Americans are satisfied with the ways their employers help them balance work and nonwork demands (36 percent in 2010 compared to 42 percent in 2009). The implications of these findings are obviously important for HRM professionals.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_p02">Before we discuss what HR professionals can do, let’s discuss some basic information about stress. As it is currently used, the term <em class="emphasis">stress</em> was coined by Hans Selye in 1936, who defined it as “the nonspecific response of the body to any demand for change.” <span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn13_012">The American Institute of Stress, accessed September 15, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.stress.org/topic-definition-stress.htm">http://www.stress.org/topic-definition-stress.htm</a>.</span> In other words, we can say that <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">stress</a><span class="glossdef">The reaction we have to a stressor.</span></span> is the reaction we have to a stressor. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">stressor</a><span class="glossdef">Some activity, event, or other stimulus that causes either a positive or a negative response in the body.</span></span> is some activity, event, or other stimulus that causes either a positive or negative reaction in the body. Despite what people may think, some stress is actually good. For example, receiving a promotion at work may cause stress, but this kind of stress is considered to be positive. Stress is very much a personal thing, and depending on individual personalities, people may have different opinions about what is a stressor and what is not. For example, a professor does not normally find public speaking to be a stressor, while someone who does not do it on a daily basis may be very stressed about having to speak in public.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_p03">Selye recognized that not all stress is negative. Positive stress is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">eustress</a><span class="glossdef">A type of stress that is healthy and gives a feeling of fulfillment and other positive feelings.</span></span>. This type of stress is healthy and gives a feeling of fulfillment and other positive feelings. Eustress can cause us to push ourselves harder to meet an end goal. On the other hand, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">distress</a><span class="glossdef">The term used for negative stress.</span></span> is the term used for negative stress. While eustress can push us, distress does not produce positive feelings and can go on for a long time without relief. We can further classify distress by <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">chronic stress</a><span class="glossdef">Prolonged exposure to stress and acute stress, which is short-term high stress.</span></span>, which is prolonged exposure to stress, and acute stress, which is short-term high stress.

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_p04">Two other terms related to stress are hyperstress and hypostress. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Hyperstress</a><span class="glossdef">A type of stress in which there are extremes with little or no relief for a long period of time, normally resulting in burnout.</span></span> is a type of stress in which there are extremes with little or no relief for a long period of time. This type of stress often results in burnout. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Hypostress</a><span class="glossdef">The lack of eustress or distress in someone’s life.</span></span> is the lack of eustress or distress in someone’s life. Remember, some stress can be good and pushes us to work harder. We see this type of stress with people who may work in a factory or other type of repetitive job. The effect of this type of stress is usually feelings of restlessness.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_p05">One last important thing to note is how a person goes through the cycle of stress. <a class="xref" href="#portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_f01">Figure 13.3 "The Stress Curve"</a> shows an example of how stress is good up to a point, but beyond that point, the person is fatigued and negatively affected by the stress. Bear in mind, this varies from person to person based on personality type and stress-coping mechanisms.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_p06">As you have already guessed, stress on the job creates productivity issues, which is why it concerns HR professionals. We know that stress can cause headaches, stomach issues, and other negative effects that can result in lost productivity but also result in less creative work. Stress can raise health insurance costs and cause employee turnover. Because of this, according to <em class="emphasis">HR Magazine</em>,<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn13_013">Kathryn Tyler, “Stress Management,” <em class="emphasis">HR Magazine</em>, September 1, 2006, accessed April 19, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.shrm.org/Publications/hrmagazine/EditorialContent/Pages/0906tyler.aspx">http://www.shrm.org/Publications/hrmagazine/EditorialContent/Pages/0906tyler.aspx</a>.</span> many employers are taking the time to identify the chief workplace stressors in employees’ lives. With this information, steps can be taken to reduce or eliminate such stress.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_p07">PricewaterhouseCoopers, for example, implemented several strategies to reduce stress in its workplace. The firm restructured its work teams so that rather than having one employee work with one client, teams of employees work with groups of clients. Rather than having an employee say, “I can’t go to my son’s baseball game because I need to wait for this client call,” this arrangement allows employees to cover for each other.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_p08">The organization also requires employees to take vacation time and even promotes it with posters throughout the office. In fact, even weekends are precious at PricewaterhouseCoopers. If an employee sends an e-mail on the weekend, a popup screen reminds her or him it is the weekend and it is time to disconnect.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_p10">Offering flextime is also a way to reduce employee stress. It allows employees to arrange their work and family schedule to one that reduces stress for them. This type of creative scheduling, according to Von Madsen, HR manager at ARUP Laboratories,<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn13_014">Kathryn Tyler, “Stress Management,” <em class="emphasis">HR Magazine</em>, September 1, 2006, accessed April 19, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.shrm.org/Publications/hrmagazine/EditorialContent/Pages/0906tyler.aspx">http://www.shrm.org/Publications/hrmagazine/EditorialContent/Pages/0906tyler.aspx</a>.</span> allows employees to work around a schedule that suits them best. Other creative ways to reduce stress might be to offer concierge services, on-site child care, wellness initiatives, and massage therapy.

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_p03">There are a number of keyboards, chairs, and other devices that can help limit or prevent CTD issues. CTD disorders cost companies money through higher health-care costs and workersworker’s compensation#8217; compensation payments. CTD is a required recordable case under OSHA. OSHA has voluntary employer guidelines for reducing CTD in specific industries such as poultry processing, shipyards, retail grocery, and nursing homes.

MCS or EI is the inability to tolerate an environmental chemical or class of foreign chemicals. Symptoms can include headache, dizziness, inability to breathe, muscle pain, and many more depending on the person. As a result, implementing policies surrounding MCS may be not only a legal requirement but a best practice to keep employees safe and healthy in the workplace. Some examples of such policies might include the following:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s04_l01">

However, many employers are reluctant to require employees to refrain from wearing or using scented products. In this case, rather than creating a policy, it might be worthwhile to simply request a fragrance-free zone from employees through e-mail and other means of communication.

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s05_p01">OSHA, as we mentioned earlier, has certain standards for how chemicals should be handled and how they should be labeled. Chemicals should be labeled in English, and employees must be able to cross-reference the chemicals to the materials safety data sheet, which describes how the chemicals should be handled.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s05_p02">It is estimated that 1,200 new chemicals are developed in North America alone every year.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn13_021">International Labor Organization, “Your Safety and Health at Work: Chemicals in the Workplace,” accessed April 25, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://actrav.itcilo.org/actrav-english/telearn/osh/kemi/ciwmain.htm">http://actrav.itcilo.org/actrav-english/telearn/osh/kemi/ciwmain.htm</a>.</span> For many of these chemicals, little is known about their immediate or long-term effects on the health of workers who come into contact with them. As a result, policies should be developed on how chemicals should be handled, and proper warnings should be given as to the harmful effects of any chemicals found in a job site.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s05_p03">In the United States, twenty-six of the fifty states have smoking bans in enclosed public spaces. These smoking bans are designed to protect workers’ health from the dangers of secondhand smoke.

The report says if the trend continues, the United States will be 100 percent smoke free by 2020. Many companies implement no-smoking policies because of health-care costs, and some companies, such as Humana, Inc., say their no-tobacco policy is simply setting a good example (since they are a health-care organization). Humana tests all applicants for tobacco in a preemployment screening that applies to all tobacco products.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn13_023">“Insurer Humana Inc.

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s06_p01">According to OSHA, 2 million American workers are victims of workplace violence every year.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn13_026">“Workplace Violence” (OSHA Fact Sheet), Occupational Safety and Health Administration, accessed April 25, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/data_General_Facts/factsheet-workplace-violence.pdf">http://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/data_General_Facts/factsheet-workplace-violence.pdf</a>.</span> OSHA addresses some of the workers who are at increased risk for workplace violence:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s06_l01">
            <li>Workers who exchange money with the public</li>
            <li>Workers who deliver goods, passengers, or services</li>
            <li>People who work alone or in small groups</li>

            <li>Workers who work in high-crime areas</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s06_p02">It is up to the organization and human resources to implement policies to ensure the safety of workers and provide a safe working environment. OSHA provides tips to provide a safer workplace:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s06_l02">
            <li>Establish a workplace violence prevention policy, with a zero tolerance policy.</li>
            <li>Provide safety education.</li>
            <li>Secure the workplace with cameras, extra lighting, and alarm systems.</li>
            <li>Provide a drop safe to limit the amount of cash on hand.</li>
            <li>Provide cell phones to workers.</li>
            <li>Require employees to travel in groups using a “buddy system.”</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s06_p03">Development of workplace policies surrounding these items is important. Ongoing training and development in these areas are key to the creation of a safe workplace. While outside influences may affect employee safety, it is also important to be aware of the employee’s safety from other employees.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Employee Privacy</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s07_p01">In today’s world of identity theft, it is important that HR professionals work to achieve maximum security and privacy for employees. When private information is exposed, it can be costly. For example, in March of 2011, the Texas Comptroller’s office inadvertently disclosed on a public website the names, addresses, and social security numbers of 3.5 million state workers.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn13_033">Patricia Hart, “Attorneys Seek to Question Texas Comptroller Over Exposed Info,” <em class="emphasis">Houston Chronicle</em>, April 26, 2011, accessed April 27, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/7537769.html">http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/7537769.html</a>.</span> The state has already spent $1.8 million to remedy this problem by sending letters to affected parties and hiring technology consultants to review office procedures. While keeping employee information private is the responsibility of all management in an organization, ensuring privacy remains the job of the HR professional.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s07_p02">Some of the things to combat employee identity theft include the following:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s07_l01">
            <li>Conduct background and criminal checks on employees who will have access to sensitive data.</li>
            <li>Restrict access to areas where data is stored, including computers.</li>
            <li>Provide training to staff who will have access to private employee information.</li>
            <li>Keep information in locked files or in password-protected files.</li>
            <li>Use numbers other than social security numbers to identify employees.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s07_p03">Another privacy issue that comes up often is the monitoring of employee activities on devices that are provided to them by the organization. Case law, for the most part, has decided that employees do not have privacy rights if they are using the organization’s equipment, with a few exceptions. As a result, more than half of all companies engage in some kind of monitoring. According to an American Management Association<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn13_034">“Electronic Monitoring and Surveillance Survey,” American Management Association, 2007, accessed April 27, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://press.amanet.org/press-releases/177/2007-electronic-monitoring-surveillance-survey/">http://press.amanet.org/press-releases/177/2007-electronic-monitoring-surveillance-survey/</a>.</span> survey, 73 percent of employers monitor e-mail messages and 66 percent monitor web surfing. If your organization finds it necessary to implement monitoring policies, ensuring the following is important to employee buy-in of the monitoring:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s07_l02">
            <li>Develop a policy for monitoring.</li>
            <li>Communicate what will be monitored.</li>
            <li>Provide business reasons for why e-mail and Internet must be monitored.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s07_p04">Working with your IT department to implement standards and protect employee data kept on computers is a must in today’s connected world. Communication of a privacy policy is an important step as well. Agrium, a Canadian-based supplier of agricultural products in North America, states its employee privacy policy on its website and shares with employees the tactics used to prevent security breaches.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn13_035">“Employee Privacy Policy,” Agrium Inc., accessed August 21, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.agrium.com/employee_privacy.jsp">http://www.agrium.com/employee_privacy.jsp</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s08_p01">Since the 9/11 attacks, terrorism and its effect on the workplace are in the forefront of the HR professional’s mind. Planning for evacuations is the job of everyone in an organization, but HR should initiate this discussion. OSHA provides free assistance in implementing plans and procedures in case of a terror attack. OSHA also provides a fill-in-the-blank system (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/evacuation/expertsystem/default.htm#">http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/evacuation/expertsystem/default.htm</a>) to help organizations write a comprehensive report for evacuations and terrorist attacks.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s09_p01">Employee health and safety is a must in today’s high-stress work environments. Although some may see employee health as something that shouldn’t concern HR, the increasing cost of health benefits makes it in the best interest of the company to hire and maintain healthy employees. In fact, during the recession of the late 2000s, when cutbacks were common, 50 percent of all workplaces increased or planned to increase investments in wellness and health at their organization.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn13_036">Donald Sears, “Gym Memberships and Wellness Programs Remain Standard Employee Benefits,” The Ladders Career Line, July 21, 2009, accessed April 27, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.career-line.com/job-search/gym-memberships-and-wellness-programs-remain-standard-employee-benefits/">http://www.career-line.com/job-search/gym-memberships-and-wellness-programs-remain-standard-employee-benefits/</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s09_p06">A safe culture doesn’t happen by requiring training sessions every year; it occurs by creating an environment in which people can recognize hazards and have the authority and ability to fix them. Instead of safety being a management focus only, every employee should take interest by being alert to the safety issues that can exist. If an employee is unable to handle the situation on his or her own, the manager should then take suggestions from employees seriously; making the change and then communicating the change to the employee can be an important component of a safe and healthy workplace.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s09_p07">A culture that promotes safety is one that never puts cost or production numbers ahead of safety. You do not want to create a culture in which health and safety priorities compete with production speedup, which can lead to a dangerous situation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s09_p08">Another option to ensure health and safety is to implement an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">employee assistance program (EAP)</a><span class="glossdef">A benefit intended to help employees with personal problems that could affect their performance at work.</span></span>. This benefit is intended to help employees with personal problems that could affect their performance at work. The EAP usually includes covered counseling and referral services. This type of program can assist employees with drug or alcohol addictions, emotional issues such as depression, stress management, or other personal issues. Sometimes these programs are outsourced to organizations that can provide in-house training and referral services to employees. For example, REI (Recreation Equipment Inc.), based in Seattle, has a comprehensive EAP for its employees in both retail stores and corporate offices.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s09_p09">Possible techniques you can implement to have a safe and healthy work environment include the following:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s09_l04">
            <li>Know OSHA and other safety laws.</li>
            <li>Provide training to employees on OSHA and safety laws.</li>
            <li>Have a written policy for how violations will be handled.</li>
            <li>Commit the resources (time and money) necessary to ensure a healthy work environment.</li>
            <li>Involve employees in safety and health discussions, as they may have good ideas as to how the organization can improve.</li>
            <li>Make safety part of an employee’s job description; in other words, hold employees accountable for always practicing safety at work.</li>
            <li>Understand how the health (or lack of health) of your employees contributes to or takes away from the bottom line and implement policies and programs to assist in this effort.</li>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch13_s02_s09_l05">
                <li>Stress is a major concern for organizations, since it can decrease productivity in the workplace. There are several types of stress.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Eustress</em> is a positive type of stress that can cause people to work harder toward a goal. <em class="emphasis">Distress</em>, on the other hand, is a type of negative stress.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Acute stress</em> occurs in short bursts, such as when finishing a project, while <em class="emphasis">chronic stress</em> tends to persist for long periods of time.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Hyperstress</em> is stress that is unrelieved for long periods of time and can often result in employee burnout. <em class="emphasis">Hypostress</em> is the lack of eustress in one’s life, which can be as damaging as other types of stress, since stress is sometimes what pushes people harder.</li>
                <li>HR professionals can encourage employees to take vacation time, offer flextime, and encourage employees to take weekends off to help reduce stress.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Cumulative trauma disorder (CTD)</em> affects the hands, fingers, arms, or shoulders as a result of continuous repetitive motions. <em class="emphasis">Carpel tunnel syndrome (CTS)</em> is a type of CTD that affects the hand and wrist. People with these disorders often work in a factory or at a desk where they are doing repetitive motions constantly, such as typing or cashiering.</li>
                <li>OSHA has voluntary guidelines for reducing CTD in the workplace. HR can assist by ensuring employees are provided with proper equipment and training.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS)</em> or <em class="emphasis">environmental illness (EI)</em> is extreme sensitivity to chemicals found in products such as hairsprays or lotions. Some individuals are extremely sensitive to other types of chemicals, such as those used in the manufacturing of carpets.</li>
                <li>MCS can be considered a disability if it limits one or more life activities. In this case, reasonable accommodations must be made, such as implementing fragrance-free zones as part of a workplace dress code.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">OSHA</em> has specific guidelines on how to handle chemicals, but other chemicals, such as those from secondhand smoke, are an important consideration in workplace safety. Twenty-six states, for example, have implemented no-smoking policies to help protect the health of workers.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Workplace violence</em> affects 2 million Americans every year. A number of groups, such as those who deliver goods, people, or services, are at greatest risk. However, workplace violence can occur internally, which is why we must be aware of the warning signs.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Workplace bullying</em> is when a person is aggressive and unreasonable in his or her behavior toward another individual. <em class="emphasis">Cyberbullying</em> is similar, except technology is used to humiliate and intimidate the employee.</li>
                <li>Keeping employee information private is the job of HR and IT. In addition, some organizations may engage in web or e-mail monitoring to ensure employees are on task. Specific policies should be developed and communicated to let employees know how they may be monitored.</li>
                <li>Some organizations have <em class="emphasis">employee assistance programs (EAPs)</em> that can provide assistance, counseling, and the like in case of personal problems or drug or alcohol abuse.</li>
                <li>To maintain a healthful working environment, know OSHA policies and make sure people are trained on the policies. Also ensure that specific policies on all areas of health and safety are communicated and employees are trained in those areas where necessary.</li>
