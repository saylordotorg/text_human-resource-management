        <h2 class="title editable block">Procedures for Grievances</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_p01">A violation of the contract terms or perception of violation normally results in a grievance. The process is specific to each contract, so we will discuss the process in generalities. A grievance is normally initiated by an employee and then handled by union representatives. Most contracts specify how the grievance is to be initiated, the steps to complete the procedure, and identification of representatives from both sides who will hear the grievance. Normally, the HR department is involved in most steps of this process. Since HRM has intimate knowledge of the contract, it makes sense for them to be involved. The basic process is shown in <a class="xref" href="#portolesedias_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_f01">Figure 12.8 "A Sample Grievance Process"</a>.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_p02">The first step is normally an informal conversation with the manager, employee, and possibly a union representative. Many grievances never go further than this step, because often the complaint is a result of a misunderstanding.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_p03">If the complaint is unresolved at this point, the union will normally initiate the grievance process by formally expressing it in writing. At this time, HR and management may discuss the grievance with a union representative. If the result is unsatisfactory to both parties, the complaint may be brought to the company’s union grievance committee. This can be in the form of an informal meeting or a more formal hearing.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_p04">After discussion, management will then submit a formalized response to the grievance. It may decide to remedy the grievance or may outline why the complaint does not violate the contract. At this point, the process is escalated.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_p05">Further discussion will likely occur, and if management and the union cannot come to an agreement, the dispute will normally be brought to a national union officer, who will work with management to try and resolve the issue. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mediator</a><span class="glossdef">An impartial third party called in to help resolve a grievance. Any recommendation or decision is not binding.</span></span> may be called in, who acts as an impartial third party and tries to resolve the issue. Any recommendation made by the mediator is not binding for either of the parties involved. Mediators can work both on grievance processes and collective bargaining issues. For example, when the National Football League (NFL) and its players failed to reach a collective bargaining agreement, they agreed to try mediation.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn12_018">Associated Press, “NFL, Union Agree to Mediation,” February 17, 2011, accessed August 15, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/NFL-players-union-agree-to-mediation-federal-for-labor-talks-CBA-021711">http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/NFL-players-union-agree-to-mediation-federal-for-labor-talks-CBA-021711</a>.</span> In this case, the agreement to go to mediation was a positive sign after several months of failed negotiations. In the end, the mediation worked, and the NFL players started the 2011–12 season on time. In Washington State (as well as most other states), a nonprofit organization is available to assist in mediations (either grievance or collective bargaining related) and arbitrations. The goal of such an organization is to avoid disruptions to public services and to facilitate the dispute resolution process. In Washington, the organization is called the Public Employment Relations Commission (PERC). <a class="xref" href="#portolesedias_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_f02">Figure 12.9 "The Mediation Process for the Public Employment Relations Commission in Washington State"</a> shows the typical grievance handling process utilizing the free PERC services.</p>

Thus arbitration is the final aspect of a grievance.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_p07">Some examples of grievances might include the following:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_l01">
            <li>One employee was promoted over another, even though he had seniority.</li>
            <li>An employee doesn’t have the tools needed to perform his or her job, as outlined in the contract.</li>
            <li>An employee was terminated, although the termination violated the rules of the contract.</li>
            <li>An employee was improperly trained on chemical handling in a department.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_p08">Most grievances fall within one of four categories.

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_p09">The important things to remember about a grievance are that it should not be taken personally and, if used correctly can be a fair, clear process to solving problems within the organization.</p>

                <li>The <em class="emphasis">grievance process</em> is a formal process to address any complaints about contract violations.</li>
                <li>The grievance process varies from contract to contract. It is an important part of the contract that ensures a fair process for both union members and management.</li>
                <li>HR is normally involved in this process, since it has intimate knowledge of the contract and laws that guide the contract.</li>
                <li>The grievance process can consist of any number of steps. First, the complaint is discussed with the manager, employee, and union representative. If no solution occurs, the grievance is put into writing by the union. Then HR, management, and the union discuss the process, sometimes in the form of a hearing in which both sides are able to express their opinion.</li>
                <li>Management then expresses its decision in writing to the union.</li>
                <li>If the union decides to escalate the grievance, the grievance may be brought to the national union for a decision. At this point, an <em class="emphasis">arbitrator</em> may be brought in, suitable to both parties, to make the final binding decision.</li>
                <li>There are four main types of grievances. First, the <em class="emphasis">individual grievance</em> is filed when one member of the union feels mistreated. A <em class="emphasis">group grievance</em> occurs when several members of the union feel they have been mistreated and file a grievance as a group. A <em class="emphasis">principle grievance</em> may be filed on behalf of the union and is usually based on a larger issue, such as a policy or contract issue. A <em class="emphasis">union or policy grievance</em> may be filed if the employee does not wish to file individually.</li>
                <li>Grievances should not be taken personally and should be considered a fair way in which to solve problems that can come up between the union and management.</li>
