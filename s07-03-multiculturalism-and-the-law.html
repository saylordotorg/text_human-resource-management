    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s03_p01">As we already know, it is in an organization’s best interest to hire and promote a multicultural and diverse workforce. Sometimes though, people are still discriminated against at work. As a result, a federal agency has been established to ensure employees have a place to file complaints should they feel discriminated against. This is the topic of <a class="xref" href="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01#portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01">Section 3.1 "Diversity and Multiculturalism"</a>. However, please note that each of these topics is discussed in <a class="xref" href="portolesedias_1.0-ch04#portolesedias_1.0-ch04">Chapter 4 "Recruitment"</a> as well, but they are also worth mentioning here.</p>
    <div class="section" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p01">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)</a><span class="glossdef">A federal agency charged with the task of enforcing federal employment discrimination laws.</span></span> is a federal agency charged with the task of enforcing federal employment discrimination laws. The laws include those that protect people from discrimination in all areas of employment, such as discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, and disability. People who have filed a discrimination charge are also protected against discrimination under the EEOC. Employers with at least fifteen employees (twenty for age discrimination) are covered under the EEOC. This agency covers not only discrimination in hiring but also discrimination in all types of work situations such as firing, promotions, harassment, training, wages, and benefits. The EEOC has the authority to investigate charges of discrimination against employers. The agency investigates the claims, makes a finding, and then tries to settle the charge. If they are unsuccessful in settling the charge, the EEOC has the right to file a lawsuit on behalf of the complainants. The EEOC has headquarters in Washington, DC, with fifty-three field offices throughout the United States.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p02">If a company has more than one hundred employees, a form called the EEO-1 must be filled out yearly. This form confirms the demographics of an organization based on different job categories.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn03_018">Equal Opportunity Employment Commission, <em class="emphasis">2011 EEO-1 Survey</em>, accessed December 20, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.eeoc.gov/employers/eeo1survey">http://www.eeoc.gov/employers/eeo1survey</a>.</span> An organization that employs more than fifty people and works for the federal government must also file an EEO-1 yearly, with the deadline normally in September. In addition, organizations must post the EEOC notice, which you have probably seen before, perhaps in the company break room. Finally, organizations should keep on file records such as hiring statistics in the event of an EEOC investigation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p03">It is necessary to mention here that while there is a legal compliance concern, as discussed before, it is in the company’s best interest to hire a diverse workforce. So while we can discuss the legal aspects, remember that the purpose of having a diverse workforce is not just to meet EEOC requirements but to create a better, more profitable workplace that better serves customers.</p>

A reasonable accommodation is defined by the EEOC as any change in the work environment or in the way things are customarily done that enables an individual with a disability to enjoy equal employment opportunities. A reasonable accommodation might include making the workplace accessible for wheelchair use or providing equipment for someone who is hearing or vision impaired.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_s02_p02">This law does not mean that organizations are required to hire unqualified people.

The EEOC’s definition of genetic information includes family medical information or information about the manifestation of a disease or disorder in an individual’s family. For example, an employer cannot discriminate against an employee whose family has a history of diabetes or cancer. This information could be used to discriminate against an employee who has an increased risk of getting a disease and may make health-care costs more expensive for the organization.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_s04_p02">In addition, the employer is not allowed to seek out genetic information by requesting, requiring, or purchasing this information.

The law protecting employees based on national origin refers to all aspects of employment: hiring, firing, pay, job assignments, promotions, layoffs, training, and fringe benefits. An employer can require an employee to speak English only if it is necessary to perform the job effectively. An English-only policy is allowed only if it is needed to ensure the safe or efficient operations of the employer’s business.

The female who is unable to perform her job owing to pregnancy must be treated the same as other temporarily disabled employees.

This law refers not only to hiring but also to firing, pay, job assignments, promotions, layoffs, training, and fringe benefits.

These characteristics might include hair texture, skin color, or facial features. Discrimination can occur when the person discriminating is the same race or color of the person who is being discriminated against. EEOC law also protects people who are married to or associated with someone of a certain race or color.

This law requires a company to reasonably accommodate an employee’s religious beliefs or practices, unless doing so would burden the organization’s operations. For example, allowing flexible scheduling during certain religious periods of time might be considered a reasonable accommodation. This law also covers accommodations in dress and grooming, such as a headscarf, religious dress, or uncut hair and a beard in the case of a Sikh. Ideally, the employee or applicant would notify the employer that he or she needs such an accommodation for religious reasons, and then a discussion of the request would occur. If it wouldn’t pose hardship, the employer should honor the request. If the request might cause a safety issue, decrease efficiency, or infringe on the rights of other employees, it may not be honored.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_s10_p01">In all the laws mentioned, the EEOC set of laws makes it illegal to fire, demote, harass, or retaliate against people because they filed a charge of discrimination, complained about discrimination, or participated in employment discrimination proceedings. Perhaps one of the most high-profile sexual harassment and retaliation cases was that of <em class="emphasis">Sanders v. Thomas</em>. Isiah Thomas, then coach of the New York Knicks, fired Anucha Browne Sanders because she hired an attorney to file sexual harassment claims charges. The jury awarded Browne Sanders $11.6 million in punitive charges because of the hostile work environment Thomas created and another $5.6 million because Browne Sanders was fired for complaining.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn03_020">Michael Schmidt, “Jury Awards $11.6 Million to Former Knicks Executive,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times,</em> October 2, 2007, accessed July 12, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/02/sports/basketball/03garden-cnd.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/02/sports/basketball/03garden-cnd.html</a>.</span> A portion of the lawsuit was to be paid by Madison Square Garden and James Dolan, chairman of Cablevision, the parent company of Madison Square Garden and the Knicks. Browne Sanders’s lawyers successfully argued that the inner workings of Madison Square Garden were hostile and lewd, and that the former marketing executive of the organization subjected her to hostility and sexual advances. Thomas left the organization as coach and president in 2008. As in this case, there are large financial and public relations penalties not only for sexual harassment but for retaliation after a harassment suit has been filed.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_s11_p01">The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERR) protects people who serve or have served in the armed forces, Reserves, National Guard, or other uniformed services. The act ensures these individuals are not disadvantaged in their civilian careers because of their service. It also requires they be reemployed in their civilian jobs upon return to service and prohibits discrimination based on past, present, or future military service.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_s11_l01">
                    <li>The <em class="emphasis">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)</em> is a federal agency charged with the development and enforcement of laws relating to multiculturalism and diversity in the workplace.</li>
                    <li>The EEOC covers discrimination based on several areas. Companies cannot discriminate based on age; EEOC law covers people who are forty years or older.</li>
                    <li>Employers cannot discriminate against people with disabilities and must provide reasonable accommodations, such as the addition of a wheelchair ramp to accommodate those with disabilities.</li>
                    <li>Equal pay refers to the fact people should legally be paid the same amount for performing the same type of work, even if the job title is different.</li>
                    <li>The newest addition to EEOC law prohibits discrimination based on genetic information, such as a history of cancer in a family.</li>
                    <li>Unfavorable treatment of people because they are from a particular country or part of the world or have an accent is covered by the EEOC. An organization cannot require people to speak English, unless it is a requirement for the job or needed for safety and efficient operation of the organization.</li>
                    <li>Women can’t be discriminated against because they are pregnant. The inability to perform certain tasks due to pregnancy should be treated as a temporary disability; accommodation can be in the form of modified tasks or alternative assignments.</li>
                    <li>The EEOC protects people from discrimination based on their race or color.</li>
                    <li>Religion is also an aspect of the EEOC family of laws. The protection of religion doesn’t allow for discrimination; accommodations include modifications of work schedules or dress to be made for religious reasons.</li>
                    <li>Discrimination on the basis of sex is illegal and covered by the EEOC. Sexual harassment is also covered by the EEOC and states that all people, regardless of sex, should work in a harassment-free environment.</li>
                    <li>Retaliation is also illegal. An organization cannot retaliate against anyone who has filed a complaint with the EEOC or a discrimination lawsuit.</li>
                    <li>The US Department of Labor oversees some aspects of EEOC laws, such as the <em class="emphasis">Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)</em>. This act requires organizations to give twelve weeks of unpaid leave in the event of an adoption, a birth, or a need to provide care to sick family members.</li>
