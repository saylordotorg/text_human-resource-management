        <h2 class="title editable block">Hiring Multicultural</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s00_p01">On a Tuesday afternoon, as you are getting ready to go to lunch, you receive an e-mail from your human resources (HR) manager about the need to hire a new project manager, and there is a $500 bonus for referring a friend who successfully joins the company. Immediately, you e-mail your friend Daniel, because you know he would be great for the job. Daniel is eventually hired for the position, and a few months later a new e-mail goes out asking for friend recommendations for a new position. You and Daniel both recommend someone, and eventually that person gets hired. Over the next year, hiring notices are not advertised externally as the organization has had good luck with this hiring practice. Seems like a great way to recruit new people, doesn’t it? It can be, but it also can be a detriment to the diversity and multiculturalism of the workplace. How, you might wonder?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s00_p02">While not true across the board, people have a tendency to spend time with people who are like themselves, in race, income level, and other aspects of diversity such as sexual orientation. In fact, according to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and a study published in the <em class="emphasis">American Journal of Sociology</em>, it is much more likely that someone will name a person in their own race as a friend than someone of a different race.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn03_001">James Moody, “Race, School Integration, and Friendship Segregation in America,” <em class="emphasis">American Journal of Sociology</em> 107, no. 3 (2001): 679–719.</span> Likewise, even from a young age, people tend to choose friends who are of the same race. As a result, when you recommend Daniel for a position, it is highly likely that Daniel is similar, from a diversity perspective, to you. Then, when Daniel recommends someone for a job, it is highly likely that he, too, is recommending someone with similar characteristics as you both. This obviously creates a lack of multicultural diversity in the workplace, which can mean lost profits for companies.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01_p01">Many people use the terms <em class="emphasis">diversity</em> and <em class="emphasis">multiculturalism</em> interchangeably, when in fact, there are major differences between the two. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Diversity</a><span class="glossdef">The real or perceived differences between individuals.</span></span> is defined as the differences between people. These differences can include race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, background, socioeconomic status, and much more. Diversity, when talking about it from the human resource management (HRM) perspective, tends to focus more on a set of policies to meet compliance standards. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) oversees complaints in this area. We discuss the EEOC in <a class="xref" href="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s03#portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s03_s01">Section 3.3.1 "Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)"</a> and in greater detail in <a class="xref" href="portolesedias_1.0-ch04#portolesedias_1.0-ch04">Chapter 4 "Recruitment"</a> and <a class="xref" href="portolesedias_1.0-ch05#portolesedias_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Selection"</a>.</p>

    <div class="section" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Power and Privilege</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_p01">As defined in this chapter, diversity focuses on the “otherness” or differences between individuals and has a goal of making sure, through policies, that everyone is treated the same. While this is the legal and the right thing to do, multiculturalism looks at a system of advantages based on race, gender, and sexual orientation called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">power and privilege</a><span class="glossdef">A system of advantages based on race, gender, sexual orientation, and other components of diversity.</span></span>. In this system, the advantages are based on a system in which one race, gender, and sexual orientation is predominant in setting societal rules and norms.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_p02">The interesting thing about power and privilege is that if you have it, you may not initially recognize it, which is why we can call it invisible privilege. Here are some examples:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Race privilege.</strong> Let’s say you (a Caucasian) and your friend (an African American) are having dinner together, and when the bill comes, the server gives the check to you. While this may not seem like a big issue, it assumes you (being Caucasian) are the person paying for the meal. This type of invisible privilege may not seem to matter if you have that privilege, but if you don’t, it can be infuriating.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Social class privilege.</strong> When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005, many people from outside the storm area wondered why so many people stayed in the city, not even thinking about the fact that some people couldn’t afford the gas to put in their car to leave the city.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Gender privilege.</strong> This refers to privileges one gender has over another—for example, the assumption that a female will change her name to her husband’s when they get married.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Sexual orientation privilege.</strong> If I am heterosexual, I can put a picture of my partner on my desk without worrying about what others think. I can talk about our vacations together or experiences we’ve had without worrying what someone might think about my relationship. This is not the case for many gay, lesbian, and transgendered people and their partners.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_p03">Oftentimes the privilege we have is considered invisible, because it can be hard to recognize one’s own privilege based on race, gender, or social class. Many people utilize the color-blind approach, which says, “I treat everyone the same” or “I don’t see people’s skin color.” In this case, the person is showing invisible privilege and thus ignoring the privileges he or she receives because of race, gender, or social class. While it appears this approach would value all people equally, it doesn’t, because people’s different needs, assets, and perspectives are disregarded by not acknowledging differences.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn03_003">Victoria C. Plaut, Kecia M. Thomas, and Matt J. Goren, “Is Multiculturalism or Color Blindness Better for Minorities?” <em class="emphasis">Psychological Science</em> 20, no. 4 (2009): 444–46.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_p04">Another important aspect of power and privilege is the fact that we may have privilege in one area and not another. For example, I am a Caucasian female, which certainly gives me race privilege but not gender privilege. Important to note here is that the idea of power and privilege is not about “white male bashing” but understanding our own stereotypes and systems of advantage so we can be more inclusive with our coworkers, employees, and managers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_p05">So what does this all mean in relation to HRM? It means we can combine the understanding of certain systems that allow for power and privilege, and by understanding we may be able to eliminate or at least minimize these issues. Besides this, one of the best things we can do for our organizations is to have a diverse workforce, with people from a variety of perspectives. This diversity leads to profitability and the ability to better serve customers. We discuss the advantages of diversity in <a class="xref" href="#portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01_s02">Section 3.1.2 "Why Diversity and Multiculturalism?"</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Why Diversity and Multiculturalism?</h2>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_p01">When many people look at diversity and multiculturalism, they think that someone’s gender, skin color, or social class shouldn’t matter. So diversity can help us with policies to prevent discrimination, while multiculturalism can help us gain a deeper understanding of the differences between people. Hopefully, over time, rather than look at diversity as attaining numerical goals or complying with the law, we can combine the concepts to create better workplaces. Although many books discuss laws relating to diversity, not many actually describe why diversity is necessary in the workplace. Here are a few main reasons:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_l01">
            <li>It is the law.</li>
            <li>We can better serve customers by offering a broader range of services, such as being able to speak a variety of languages and understanding other cultures.</li>
            <li>We can better communicate with one another (saving time and money) and customers.</li>
            <li>With a multicultural perspective, we can create better ideas and solutions.</li>

<em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> 500 Focus</h3>
            <p class="para" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_p02">Hilton is one of the most recognized names in the hotel industry. Hilton employs 130,000 people in 3,750 hotels in 84 countries. The hotel chain, with some locations franchised, focuses on diversity and inclusion as part of its operations. First, it has a director of global diversity and inclusion, who plays a key role in executing the Hilton global diversity and inclusion efforts, which are focused on culture, talent, workplace, and marketplace diversity strategies. Each Hilton brand must establish its own diversity performance goals and initiatives, which are monitored by the diversity council. The diversity council is made up of the company board of directors, the CEO, and vice president of human resources. At any given time, Hilton has thirty or more diversity initiatives in place,<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn03_004">Jason Forsythe, “Leading with Diversity,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times,</em> 2005, accessed July 13, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/marketing/jobmarket/diversity/hilton.html">http://www.nytimes.com/marketing/jobmarket/diversity/hilton.html</a>.</span> which are managed by the diversity council.</p>
            <p class="para" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_p03">Hilton has created several diversity programs within the communities in which the hotels operate. For example, Hilton was one of the first hotel chains to develop an outreach program to educate minority and female entrepreneurs for franchise investments. One part of the program includes invitation-only seminars that discuss what it takes to be a successful hotel owner. Hilton says its diversity seminars are driven by the fact that it wants employees to reflect the diversity of the customers.</p>
            <p class="para" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_p04">In addition to the outreach program, Hilton partners with historically black colleges and universities for recruiting, which creates an effective tie to jobs once students graduate. It has developed a supplier tracking system, so it knows the total number of supplier payments made and how many of those suppliers are female or minorities. William A. Holland, the vice president for workforce planning and analysis says, “It takes leadership to make diversity work, and our diversity initiative comes from the highest levels of our organization.”<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn03_005">Jason Forsythe, “Leading with Diversity,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times,</em> 2005, accessed July 13, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/marketing/jobmarket/diversity/hilton.html">http://www.nytimes.com/marketing/jobmarket/diversity/hilton.html</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_p05">Promoting a multicultural work environment isn’t just the law. Through a diverse work environment and multicultural understanding, organizations can attain greater profitability. A study by Cedric Herring called <em class="emphasis">Does Diversity Pay?</em><span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn03_006">Cedric Herring, “Does Diversity Pay? Racial Composition of Firms and the Business Case for Diversity” (paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association, Montreal, Canada, August 11, 2006), accessed May 5, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/0/1/7/9/pages101792/p101792-1.php">http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/0/1/7/9/pages101792/p101792-1.php</a>.</span> reveals that diversity does, in fact, pay. The study found those businesses with greater racial diversity reporter higher sales revenues, more customers, larger market shares, and greater relative profits than those with more homogeneous workforces. Other research on the topic by Scott Page, the author of <em class="emphasis">The Difference: How the Power of Diversity Creates Better Groups, Firms, Schools, and Societies</em><span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn03_007">Scott E. Page, <em class="emphasis">The Difference: How the Power of Diversity Creates Better Groups, Firms, Schools, and Societies</em> (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2007).</span> ended up with similar results. Page found that people from varied backgrounds are more effective at working together than those who are from similar backgrounds, because they offer different approaches and perspectives in the development of solutions. Often people believe that diversity is about checking a box or only providing window dressing to gain more customers, but this isn’t the case. As put by Eric Foss, chairperson and CEO of Pepsi Beverages Company, “It’s not a fad. It’s not an idea of the month. It’s central and it’s linked very directly to business strategy.”<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn03_008">William J. Holstein, “Diversity is Even More Important in Hard Times,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, February 13, 2009, accessed August 25, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/14/business/14interview.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/14/business/14interview.html</a>.</span> A study by the late Roy Adler of Pepperdine University shows similar results. His 19-year study of 215 <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> 500 companies shows a strong correlation between female executives and high profitability.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn03_009">Roy Adler, “Women in the Executive Suite Correlate to High Profits,” Glass Ceiling Research Center.</span> Another study, conducted by Project Equality, found that companies that rated low on equal opportunity issues earned 7.9 percent profit, while those who rated highest with more equal opportunities resulted in 18.3 percent profit.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn03_010">Melissa Lauber, “Studies Show That Diversity in Workplace Is Profitable,” <em class="emphasis">Project Equality</em>, n.d., accessed July 11, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.villagelife.org/news/archives/diversity.html">http://www.villagelife.org/news/archives/diversity.html</a>.</span> These numbers show that diversity and multiculturalism certainly is not a fad, but a way of doing business that better serves customers and results in higher profits.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_p06">As managers, we need to recognize this and develop policies that recognize not only the importance of diversity but the importance of nurturing multicultural understanding in the workplace. Many employees, however, may be resistant to a discussion on diversity and multiculturalism. Much of this may have to do with their own power and privilege, but some resistance may be related to the discomfort people may feel when faced with the realization that change is a necessity and the cultural makeup of the workplace is changing. Some people may feel “We’ve always done it this way” and are less willing to change to the new ways of doing things.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_p07">Perhaps one of the best diversity statements by a <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> 500 company was made by Jose Manuel Souto, the CFO for Visa in Latin America. He says, “A diverse workforce is critical to providing the best service to our global clients, supporting our business initiatives, and creating a workplace environment that promotes respect and fairness.”<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn03_011">National Latina Business Women Association, “Women and Minorities on Corporate Boards Still Lags Far Behind National Population,” accessed August 24, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://nlbwa.org/component/content/article/64-nationalnews/137-procon-and-asian-global-sourcing-conference">http://nlbwa.org/component/content/article/64-nationalnews/137-procon-and-asian-global-sourcing-conference</a>.</span></p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s02_p01">While state and federal laws must be followed to ensure multiculturalism, the culture of the company and the way the organization operates can contribute to the nurturing of a multicultural environment (or not). Most companies have a formalized and written antidiscrimination and harassment policy. For example, Zappos’s policy states, “The diversity of Zappos’ employees is a tremendous asset. We are firmly committed to providing equal opportunity in all aspects of employment and will not tolerate any illegal discrimination or harassment. Examples of such behavior include derogatory comments based on racial or ethnic characteristics and unwelcome sexual advances. Please refer to the applicable sections of the Employee Handbook for further guidance.” <span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn03_012">Zappos.com, accessed August 25, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://about.zappos.com/our-unique-culture/zappos-core-values/build-open-and-honest-relationships-communication">http://about.zappos.com/our-unique-culture/zappos-core-values/build-open-and-honest-relationships-communication</a>.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s02_p02">Implementing a policy is an excellent first step, but what is important is how the company acts on those formalized processes and written policies. Let’s say, for example, an organization has a published policy on inclusion of those with physical disabilities, but much “schmoozing” and relationship development with managers takes place on the golf course on Friday afternoons. While the policy states the company doesn’t discriminate, their actions and “traditions” show otherwise and do discriminate against those with disabilities. If this is where the informal work and relationship building take place, an entire group could be left out of this process, likely resulting in lower pay and promotion rates. Likewise, organizations that have a “beer Friday” environment may discriminate against those whose religions do not condone drinking alcohol. While none of these situations are examples of blatant discrimination, a company’s culture can contribute to an environment that is exclusive rather than inclusive.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s02_p03">Many organizations have developed diversity management plans that are tied to the written diversity policy of the organization. In fact, in many larger organizations, such as Hilton, manager- or director-level positions have been created to specifically manage diversity plans and programs. Josh Greenberg, a researcher in the area of workplace diversity, contends that organizations with specific diversity plans tend to be able to facilitate changes more quickly than companies without diversity plans.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn03_013">Josh Greenberg, “Diversity in the Workplace: Benefits, Challenges, Solutions,” The Multicultural Advantage, 2004, accessed July 12, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.multiculturaladvantage.com/recruit/diversity/Diversity-in-the-Workplace-Benefits-Challenges-Solutions.asp">http://www.multiculturaladvantage.com/recruit/diversity/Diversity-in-the-Workplace-Benefits-Challenges-Solutions.asp</a>.</span> He says there are three main steps to creating diversity plans:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s02_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Assessment of diversity.</strong> Employee satisfaction surveys, discussions, and open forums that can provide insight into the challenges and obstacles to diversity. Inclusion of all workers for input is necessary to create a useful plan.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Development of the diversity plan.</strong> Based on step 1, a series of attainable and measurable goals should be developed regarding workplace diversity.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Implementation of the plan.</strong> The commitment of executives and management is necessary. Formulating action plans based on the goals developed in step 2 and assignment of implementation and measurement of those plans must follow. The action plan should be the responsibility of the entire organization, not just the director of diversity or human resources.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s02_p04">In <a class="xref" href="#portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s02_s01">Section 3.2.1 "Recruitment and Selection"</a>, we discuss some of the HR plan considerations in company culture and “our way of doing things” that are worth considering when creating a diversity plan.</p>
    <div class="section" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Recruitment and Selection</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_p01">As you saw in the opening of <a class="xref" href="portolesedias_1.0-ch03#portolesedias_1.0-ch03">Chapter 3 "Diversity and Multiculturalism"</a>, sometimes organizations do not mean to be exclusive or discriminatory, but their practices are discriminatory and illegal. For example, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) says it is illegal to publish a job advertisement that shows a preference for a particular type of person or discourages someone from applying for a job. For example, a Facebook post that says “recent college graduates wanted” might be inclusive to a younger group and discouraging to a diverse (older) workforce, not making the post multicultural. Another example might be the reliance on word-of-mouth advertisement for job openings. Suppose you have a mostly Hispanic workforce and use word of mouth for recruitment. It is likely that most new hires will also be Hispanic. This is also illegal, but perhaps a consideration is the lack of diversity you will have in your workplace with these recruitment methods.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_p02">Make sure that job announcements aren’t posted only for your Facebook friends to see; post them in a variety of places to gain the largest and most diverse response.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_p03">We address discrimination in the selection process in <a class="xref" href="portolesedias_1.0-ch05#portolesedias_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Selection"</a>. However, a mention of the four-fifths rule here is important to determine how we can quantitatively evaluate discrimination in our selection practices. One way to calculate possible discrimination is by using the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">four-fifths rule</a><span class="glossdef">The rule states that a selection rate for any race, sex, or ethnic group that is less than four-fifths of the rate for the group with the highest rate could be regarded as adverse impact.</span></span>, or 80 percent rule. The rule states that a selection rate for any race, sex, or ethnic group that is less than four-fifths of the rate for the group with the highest rate could be regarded as adverse impact. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Adverse impact</a><span class="glossdef">Refers to employment practices that may appear to be neutral but have a discriminatory effect on a protected group.</span></span> refers to employment practices that may appear to be neutral but have a discriminatory effect on a protected group. For example, let’s assume 100 women and 500 men applied to be firefighters. Let’s say 20 of those women were hired and 250 men were hired. To determine adverse impact based on the four-fifths rule, calculate the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_l01">
            <li>Selection rate for women: 20 percent</li>
            <li>Selection rate for men: 50 percent</li>
            <li>Then divide the highest selection rate: .20/.50 = .4</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_p04">Because .4, or 40 percent, is less than four-fifths, there may be adverse impact in the selection process for firefighters.</p>

    <div class="section" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Testing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p01">If employment tests are required, a test must be in direct relation to the job. For example, an organization that uses a personality test in hiring must be able to show that the personality test results are nondiscriminatory and do not exclude a population.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p02">In addition, if a reasonable accommodation is needed, such as an interpreter, and it does not cause financial difficulty for the organization, this should be granted.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p03">Also consider the type of test and how it might exclude a certain group of people, such as those who don’t speak English as a first language. We will discuss multiculturalism and testing further in <a class="xref" href="portolesedias_1.0-ch05#portolesedias_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Selection"</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Pay and Promotion</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s02_s03_p01">Development of policies related to pay and promotion is key to fairness in a multicultural situation. It is widely published that women make about 77 percent of what men earn for similar jobs.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn03_014">National Committee on Pay Equity, accessed August 25, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.iwpr.org/initiatives/pay-equity-and-discrimination/#publications">http://www.iwpr.org/initiatives/pay-equity-and-discrimination/#publications</a>.</span> Many studies have tried to determine a cause for this pay inequity, and here are some of the possible reasons studied and researched:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s02_s03_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Hours worked.</strong> Studies have said that women tend to work fewer hours because of child-care and housework expectations.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Occupational choice.</strong> A study performed by Anne York at Meredith College<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn03_015">E. Anne York, “Gender Differences in the College and Career Aspirations of High School Valedictorians,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Advanced Academics</em> 19, no. 4 (Summer 2008): 578–600, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/detail?accno=EJ822323">http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/detail?accno=EJ822323</a>.</span> found that women tend to choose careers that pay less because they are worried about balancing family and career. In addition, numerous studies show that women choose careers on the basis of gender stereotypes (e.g., nurse, teacher) and that this leads to lower pay.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Stereotypes.</strong> The concept of male bias is a possibility. In many studies, people were more likely to choose male doctors over female doctors, even when experience and education were the same.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn03_016">David R. Hekman, Karl Aquino and Brad P. Owens, “An Examination of Whether and How Racial and Gender Biases Influence Customer Satisfaction,” <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Journal</em> 53, no. 2 (April 2010): 238–264.</span> There appears to be a perception that men may be more competent in certain types of jobs.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Maternity and family leave.</strong> Women leaving the workforce for a short or extended period of time may affect the perception of promotability in the workplace.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Salary negotiation.</strong> A study performed by Bowles and Babcock<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn03_017">Hannah Riley Bowles and Linda Babcock, “When Doesn’t It Hurt Her to Ask? Framing and Justification Reduce the Social Risks of Initiating Compensation” (paper presented at IACM 21st Annual Conference, December 14, 2008): accessed August 25, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1316162">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1316162</a>.</span> showed that men were eight times more likely to negotiate salary than women. In addition, when women did negotiate, they received lower monetary returns. Consider a study performed by Cornell University, which found that women were often negatively affected in their job when they negotiated salary, as compared to men not being viewed negatively after negotiations.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s02_s03_p02">Whatever the reason for pay difference, all managers should be aware of these differences when hiring and promoting. Allowing managers to determine the pay for their employees can also bring out negative stereotypes—and lead to breaking of the law. Determining a set pay schedule for all new and promoted employees can help remedy this situation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s02_s03_p03">A factor in promotions can also be the mentor-mentee relationship. Most individuals in organizations will have an informal mentor who helps them “through the ranks.” Traditionally, this informal mentor relationship results in someone “pairing up” with another who has similar physical characteristics, is the same gender, or has a similar mind-set. As a result, if the organization has, for example, mostly men, it is likely the female will not be informally mentored, which can result in lack of promotion. Likewise, if the workforce consists of mostly Caucasian females, it is likely the African American male may not develop an informal mentor relationship with his female counterparts. Development of a formal mentorship program to ensure that everyone has a mentor is one way to alleviate this situation. Mentorship programs are discussed in <a class="xref" href="portolesedias_1.0-ch08#portolesedias_1.0-ch08">Chapter 8 "Training and Development"</a>.</p>

    <div class="section" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s02_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Now What?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s02_s04_p01">Now that you have an awareness of the aspects of HR that could be affected by multiculturalism, you may consider what steps you can take to create a more multicultural workplace. The first step would be to create a diversity plan, as discussed earlier in this section. The second step would be to look at the operation of the HR department and to figure out what departmental measures can be taken to promote diversity.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s02_s04_p02">HR, for example, can provide a training series on power and privilege and how it relates to the workplace. Awareness is the first step to creating a truly multicultural environment. Once employees recognize their own power and privilege, the training could be developed to include laws related to diversity, and discussions on bias can take place. Then discussions can be held on how to improve HR plans such as job analysis, recruitment, and selection to create a multicultural work environment. Rather than thinking about this training as one of many objectives that must be accomplished, think about the training from the conversation perspective. Getting the conversation started is the first step in this personal and professional development process for employees.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s02_s04_p03">Some of the aspects to creating a training focused on multiculturalism might include the following:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s02_s04_l01">
            <li>Build a cultural knowledge about customs, religions, and histories.</li>
            <li>Discuss treatment of people based on them as individuals, rather than as part of a “group,” which can result in stereotyping.</li>
            <li>Teach employees to listen actively, which can help raise cultural awareness.</li>
            <li>Train employees to rethink current policies and how those policies might be exclusive to a certain group.</li>
            <li>Work on resistance to change. Many employees think, “This is the way we have always done it, and now we have to change it because we have a group of ____ working here now.”</li>
            <li>Does your leadership team have a multiculturalism perspective? Are many ethnic backgrounds and other multicultural traits represented?</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s02_s04_p04">While these suggestions may not eliminate power and privilege, the ability to talk about differences and expectations can be a key ingredient to creating a more inclusive environment. Sometimes this type of training can help people evaluate their perceptions. For example, suppose a complaint came through that a woman was making derogatory sexual comments to only one group of men in an organization. When talked to about it, she said she made comments to the “techies” because she thought the comments would provide them a needed confidence boost, but she generally wouldn’t make those types of comments. This is an example of her perception (“techies” need confidence boosts from women) followed by her action (the comments) on this perception. When we assume our perceptions are correct, we are usually wrong. Training can get people to consider their emotions, stereotypes, and expectations. Besides training, asking ourselves a series of important questions can be the start to making diversity and multiculturalism work. The University of California, San Francisco human resource department lists some of these questions, which are shown in the sidebar.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p01">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)</a><span class="glossdef">A federal agency charged with the task of enforcing federal employment discrimination laws.</span></span> is a federal agency charged with the task of enforcing federal employment discrimination laws. The laws include those that protect people from discrimination in all areas of employment, such as discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, and disability. People who have filed a discrimination charge are also protected against discrimination under the EEOC. Employers with at least fifteen employees (twenty for age discrimination) are covered under the EEOC. This agency covers not only discrimination in hiring but also discrimination in all types of work situations such as firing, promotions, harassment, training, wages, and benefits. The EEOC has the authority to investigate charges of discrimination against employers. The agency investigates the claims, makes a finding, and then tries to settle the charge. If they are unsuccessful in settling the charge, the EEOC has the right to file a lawsuit on behalf of the complainants. The EEOC has headquarters in Washington, DC, with fifty-three field offices throughout the United States.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p02">If a company has more than one hundred employees, a form called the EEO-1 must be filled out yearly.

In addition, organizations must post the EEOC notice, which you have probably seen before, perhaps in the company break room. Finally, organizations should keep on file records such as hiring statistics in the event of an EEOC investigation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p03">It is necessary to mention here that while there is a legal compliance concern, as discussed before, it is in the company’s best interest to hire a diverse workforce. So while we can discuss the legal aspects, remember that the purpose of having a diverse workforce is not just to meet EEOC requirements but to create a better, more profitable workplace that better serves customers.</p>

This law requires a company to reasonably accommodate an employee’s religious beliefs or practices, unless doing so would burden the organization’s operations. For example, allowing flexible scheduling during certain religious periods of time might be considered a reasonable accommodation. This law also covers accommodations in dress and grooming, such as a headscarf, religious dress, or uncut hair and a beard in the case of a Sikh. Ideally, the employee or applicant would notify the employer that he or she needs such an accommodation for religious reasons, and then a discussion of the request would occur. If it wouldn’t pose hardship, the employer should honor the request. If the request might cause a safety issue, decrease efficiency, or infringe on the rights of other employees, it may not be honored.</p>

Perhaps one of the most high-profile sexual harassment and retaliation cases was that of <em class="emphasis">Sanders v. Thomas</em>. Isiah Thomas, then coach of the New York Knicks, fired Anucha Browne Sanders because she hired an attorney to file sexual harassment claims charges.

Browne Sanders’s lawyers successfully argued that the inner workings of Madison Square Garden were hostile and lewd, and that the former marketing executive of the organization subjected her to hostility and sexual advances. Thomas left the organization as coach and president in 2008.

                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_s11_l01">
                    <li>The <em class="emphasis">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)</em> is a federal agency charged with the development and enforcement of laws relating to multiculturalism and diversity in the workplace.</li>
                    <li>The EEOC covers discrimination based on several areas. Companies cannot discriminate based on age; EEOC law covers people who are forty years or older.</li>
                    <li>Employers cannot discriminate against people with disabilities and must provide reasonable accommodations, such as the addition of a wheelchair ramp to accommodate those with disabilities.</li>
                    <li>Equal pay refers to the fact people should legally be paid the same amount for performing the same type of work, even if the job title is different.</li>
                    <li>The newest addition to EEOC law prohibits discrimination based on genetic information, such as a history of cancer in a family.</li>
                    <li>Unfavorable treatment of people because they are from a particular country or part of the world or have an accent is covered by the EEOC. An organization cannot require people to speak English, unless it is a requirement for the job or needed for safety and efficient operation of the organization.</li>
                    <li>Women can’t be discriminated against because they are pregnant. The inability to perform certain tasks due to pregnancy should be treated as a temporary disability; accommodation can be in the form of modified tasks or alternative assignments.</li>
                    <li>The EEOC protects people from discrimination based on their race or color.</li>
                    <li>Religion is also an aspect of the EEOC family of laws. The protection of religion doesn’t allow for discrimination; accommodations include modifications of work schedules or dress to be made for religious reasons.</li>
                    <li>Discrimination on the basis of sex is illegal and covered by the EEOC. Sexual harassment is also covered by the EEOC and states that all people, regardless of sex, should work in a harassment-free environment.</li>
                    <li>Retaliation is also illegal. An organization cannot retaliate against anyone who has filed a complaint with the EEOC or a discrimination lawsuit.</li>
                    <li>The US Department of Labor oversees some aspects of EEOC laws, such as the <em class="emphasis">Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)</em>. This act requires organizations to give twelve weeks of unpaid leave in the event of an adoption, a birth, or a need to provide care to sick family members.</li>

            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Diversity</em> is the real or perceived differences between individuals. Diversity can include race, gender, sexual orientation, size, cultural background, and many other differences. <em class="emphasis">Multiculturalism</em> is similar to diversity but focuses on the development of a greater understanding of how power in society can be unequal because of race, gender, sexual orientation, power, and privilege.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Power and privilege</em> is a system of advantages based on one’s race, gender, and sexual orientation. This system can often be invisible (to those who have it), which results in one race or gender having unequal power in the workplace. Of course, this unequal power results in unfairness, which may be a legal concern.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Diversity</em> is important to the success of organizations. Many studies have shown a direct link between the amount of diversity in a workplace and the success of the company.</li>
            <li>Oftentimes there are cultural aspects to an organization that make it resistant to an inclusive environment. These are often not obvious, but awareness of how your own company culture impacts multiculturalism is important. Job announcements, testing, and pay differences are company culture components that can create exclusive environments.</li>
            <li>In recruitment, awareness of how and where you post announcements is crucial. Development of a set pay scale can alleviate some of the issues surrounding unfair pay, especially between men and women.</li>
            <li>Formal mentorship programs can create multicultural understanding and ensure people do not stick with their own race or gender when helping someone move up the ranks in an organization.</li>
            <li>The <em class="emphasis">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)</em> is a federal agency charged with development and enforcement of laws relating to multiculturalism and diversity in the workplace.</li>
            <li>The EEOC covers discrimination based on several areas. Companies cannot discriminate based on age—that is, against someone who is forty or older. They also can’t discriminate against people with disabilities or on the basis of race, genetic information, national origin, gender, or religion.</li>
            <li>Retaliation is also illegal, based on EEOC laws. An organization cannot retaliate against anyone who has filed a complaint with the EEOC or a discrimination lawsuit.</li>
            <li>The US Department of Labor oversees some aspects of EEOC laws, such as the <em class="emphasis">Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)</em>. This act requires organizations to give twelve weeks of unpaid leave in the event of an adoption, birth, or caregiving of sick family members.</li>

        <p class="simpara">But…It’s Our Company Culture!</p>
        <p class="para" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s04_p01">You are the HR manager for a fifty-person firm that specializes in the development and marketing of plastics technologies. When you were hired, you felt the company had little idea what you should be paid and just made up a number, which you were able to negotiate to a slightly higher salary. While you have been on the job for three months, you have noticed a few concerning things in the area of multiculturalism, besides the way your salary was offered. The following are some of those items:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s04_l02">
            <li>You know that some of the sales team, including the sales manager, get together once a month to have drinks at a strip club.</li>
            <li>A Hispanic worker left the organization, and in his exit interview, he complained of not seeing a path toward promotion.</li>
            <li>The only room available for breast-feeding mothers is the women’s restroom.</li>
            <li>The organization has a policy of offering $200 to any employee who refers a friend, as long as the friend is hired and stays at least six months.</li>
            <li>The manufacturing floor has an English-only policy.</li>
            <li>You have heard managers refer to those wearing turbans in a derogatory way.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s04_p02">What do you think needs to be done to create a more inclusive environment, without losing the culture of the company? What suggestions would you make to those involved in each of the situations?</p>
