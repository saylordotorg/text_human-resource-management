        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s05_l01">
            <li>Employee training and development is a necessity in today’s work environment. Training and development can lead to lower turnover and increased motivation.</li>
            <li>There are four basic steps to employee training: employee orientation, in-house training, mentoring, and external training.</li>
            <li>Different types of training can be delivered, each falling into the steps of employee training. These include technical or technology training, quality training, skills training, soft skills training, professional training, team training, managerial training, and safety training.</li>
            <li>Within the types of training, we need to determine which method is best for the actual delivery of training. Options include on-the-job training, mentor training, brown bag lunches, web-based training, job shadowing, job swapping, and vestibule training.</li>
            <li>Development of a training development framework is the first step in solidifying the training.</li>
            <li>Considerations and steps to developing the training framework include determining the training needs, delivery modes, budget, delivery style, audience, content, time lines, communication of the training, and measurement of the training.</li>
            <li>Career development programs can be an essential piece to the training puzzle. A comprehensive program or plan, either developed by employees or administered by HR, can help with motivation and fill the gap when people in the organization leave or retire. It can also be used as a motivational tool.</li>

        <p class="simpara">New on the Job</p>
        <p class="para" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s05_p01">JoAnn Michaels just started her job as human resources manager at In the Dog House, a retail chain specializing in dog apparel and accessories. She is a good friend of yours you met in college.</p>
        <p class="para" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s05_p02">The organization has 35 stores with 250 employees in Washington, Idaho, and Oregon. As the chain has grown, the training programs have been conducted somewhat piecemeal. Upon visiting some of the stores in a three-week tour, JoAnn has realized that all the stores seem to have different ways of training their in-store employees.</p>
        <p class="para" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s05_p03">When she digs further, she realizes even the corporate offices, which employ seventy-five people, have no formal training program. In the past, they have done informal and optional brown bag lunch training to keep employees up to date. As a result, JoAnn develops a survey using SurveyMonkey and sends it to all seventy-five corporate employees. She created a rating system, with 1 meaning strongly disagree and 5 meaning strongly agree. Employees were not required to answer all questions, hence the variation in the number of responses column. After this task, JoAnn creates a slightly different survey and sends it to all store managers, asking them to encourage their retail employees to take the survey. The results are shown here.</p>
