        <h2 class="title editable block">Types of Performance Issues</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s01_p01">One of the most difficult parts of managing others isn’t when they are doing a great job—it is when they aren’t doing a good job. In this section, we will address some examples of performance issues and how to handle them.</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Constantly late or leaves early.</strong> While we know that flexible schedules can provide a work-life balance, managing this flexible schedule is key. Some employees may take advantage and, instead of working at home, perform nonwork-related tasks instead.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Too much time spent doing personal things at work.</strong> Most companies have a policy about using a computer or phone for personal use. For most companies, some personal use is fine, but it can become a problem if someone doesn’t know where to draw the line.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Inability to handle proprietary information.</strong> Many companies handle important client and patient information. The ability to keep this information private for the protection of others is important to the success of the company.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Family issues.</strong> Child-care issues, divorce, or other family challenges can cause absenteeism, but also poor work quality. Absenteeism is defined as a habitual pattern of not being at work.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Drug and alcohol abuse.</strong> The US Department of Labor says that 40 percent of industrial fatalities and 47 percent of industrial injury can be tied to alcohol consumption. The US Department of Labor estimates that employees who use substances are 25–30 percent less productive and miss work three times more often than nonabusing employees.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn10_001">United States Department of Labor, “General Workplace Impact,” 2011, accessed March 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.esrcheck.com/wordpress/2011/08/12/studies-show-drugs-in-workplace-cost-employers-billions-and-small-businesses-employ-more-drug-users-but-drug-test-less/">http://www.esrcheck.com/wordpress/2011/08/12/studies-show-drugs-in-workplace-cost-employers-billions- and-small-businesses-employ-more-drug-users-but-drug-test-less/</a>.</span> Please keep in mind that when we talk about substance abuse, we are talking about not only illegal drugs but prescription drug abuse as well. In fact, the National Institute on Drug Abuse says that 15.2 million Americans have taken a prescription pain reliever, tranquilizer, or sedative for nonmedical purposes at least once.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn10_002">Barry Fisher, “Targeting Prescription Drug Abuse,” <em class="emphasis">Ventura County Star</em>, March 6, 2011, accessed March 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.vcstar.com/news/2011/mar/06/targeting-prescription-drug-abuse/">http://www.vcstar.com/news/2011/mar/06/targeting-prescription-drug-abuse/</a>.</span> Substance abuse can cause obvious problems, such as tardiness, absenteeism, and nonperformance, but it can also result in accidents or other more serious issues.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Nonperforming.</strong> Sometimes employees are just not performing at their peak. Some causes may include family or personal issues, but oftentimes it can mean motivational issues or lack of tools and/or ability to do their current job.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Conflicts with management or other employees.</strong> While it is normal to have the occasional conflict at work, some employees seem to have more than the average owing to personality issues. Of course, this affects an organization’s productivity.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Theft.</strong> The numbers surrounding employee theft are staggering. The American Marketing Association estimates $10 billion is lost annually owing to employee theft, while the FBI estimates up to $150 billion annually.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn10_003">“Employee Theft and Legal Aspects,” Net Industries, accessed March 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://law.jrank.org/pages/1084/Employee-Theft-Legal-Aspects-Estimates-cost.html">http://law.jrank.org/pages/1084/Employee-Theft-Legal-Aspects-Estimates-cost.html</a>.</span> Obviously, this is a serious employee problem that must be addressed.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Ethical breaches.</strong> The most commonly reported ethical breaches by employees include lying, withholding information, abusive behavior, and misreporting time or hours worked, according to a National Business Ethics study.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn10_004">“Careers By the Numbers,” <em class="emphasis">InfoWorld</em>, October 2, 2000, accessed August 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ST0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=Careers+By+the+Numbers+InfoWorld+October+2,+2000&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KU2eMTa3C3&amp;sig=rU3s8ywYcc0ZkUbuydMO3wrO1Rc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yoVsT6PfGYSw0QH11u3TBg&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Careers%20By%20the%20Numbers%20InfoWorld%20October%202%2C%202000&amp;f=false">http://books.google.com/books?id=ST0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=Careers+By+the+Numbers +InfoWorld+October+2,+2000&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KU2eMTa3C3&amp;sig=rU3s8ywYcc0Z kUbuydMO3wrO1Rc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yoVsT6PfGYSw0QH11u3TBg&amp;ved=0CCIQ6 AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q= Careers%20By%20the%20Numbers%20InfoWorld%20October %202%2C%202000&amp;f=false</a>.</span> Sharing certain proprietary information when it is against company policy and violating noncompete agreements are also considered ethical violations. Many companies also have a nonfraternization policy that restricts managers from socializing with nonmanagement employees.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Harassment.</strong> Engagement of sexual harassment, bullying, or other types of harassment would be considered an issue to be dealt with immediately and, depending on the severity, may result in immediate termination.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Employee conduct outside the workplace.</strong> Speaking poorly of the organization on blogs or Facebook is an example of conduct occurring outside the workplace that could violate company policy. Violating specific company policies outside work could also result in termination. For example, in 2010, thirteen Virgin Atlantic employees were fired after posting criticisms about customers and joking about the lack of safety on Virgin airplanes in a public Facebook group.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn10_005">Catherine Smith, “Fired Over Facebook,” <em class="emphasis">Huffington Post</em>, July 2010, accessed August 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/26/fired-over-facebook-posts_n_659170.html#s115752&amp;title=13_Virgin_Atlantic">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/26/fired-over-facebook-posts_n_659170.html#s115752&amp;title=13_Virgin_Atlantic</a>.</span> In another example, an NFL Indianapolis Colts cheerleader was fired after racy Playboy promotional photos surfaced (before she became a cheerleader) that showed her wearing only body paint.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn10_006">Rick Chandler, “Ex-Colts Cheerleader Sues Team Over Dismissal for Playboy Pics,” NBC Sports, May 11, 2011, accessed August 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://offthebench.nbcsports.com/2011/05/11/ex-colts-cheerleader-sues-team-over-dismissal-for-playboy-pics/">http://offthebench.nbcsports.com/2011/05/11/ex-colts-cheerleader-sues-team-over-dismissal-for-playboy-pics/</a>.</span>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s01_p02">While certainly not exhaustive, this list provides some insight into the types of problems that may be experienced. As you can see, some of these problems are more serious than others. Some issues may only require a warning, while some may require immediate dismissal. As an HR professional, it is your job to develop policies and procedures for dealing with such problems. Let’s discuss these next.</p>

            <p class="para" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s01_p03">To handle attendance problems at many organizations, a no-fault attendance plan is put into place. In this type of plan, employees are allowed a certain number of absences; when they exceed that number, a progressive discipline process begins and might result in dismissal of the employee. A no-fault attendance policy means there are no excused or unexcused absences, and all absences count against an employee. For example, a company might give one point for an absence that is called in the night before work, a half point for a tardy, and two points for a no-call and no-show absence. When an employee reaches a certain number determined by the company, he or she is disciplined. This type of policy is advantageous in industries in which unplanned absences have a direct effect on productivity, such as manufacturing and production. Another advantage is that managers do not need to make judgment calls on what is an excused versus an unexcused absence, and this can result in fairness to all employees.</p>
            <p class="para" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s01_p04">One such company with a no-fault attendance policy is Verizon Communications. However, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) investigated this policy and announced that Verizon will pay $20 million to resolve a disability discrimination lawsuit.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn10_007">Jim Evans, “EEOC Finds Fault with Company’s No Fault Attendance Plan,” <em class="emphasis">Zanesville Times</em>, July 17, 2011, accessed August 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessmanagementdaily.com/19860/eeoc-finds-fault-with-no-fault-attendance-policies">http://www.businessmanagementdaily.com/19860/eeoc-finds-fault-with-no-fault-attendance-policies</a>.</span> The lawsuit said that the company, through use of the no-fault attendance policy, denied reasonable accommodations required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). As a result, hundreds of Verizon employees were disciplined or fired. In this case, the EEOC cites paid or unpaid leave as one way for an employer to provide reasonable accommodations for an employee with a disability. The policy specified there would be no exceptions made to the no-fault attendance policy to accommodate employees with ADA disabilities. When discussing the case, the EEOC chair justified the agency’s position by saying, “Flexibility on leave can enable a worker with a disability to remain employed and productive, a win for the worker, employer, and the economy. By contrast, an inflexible leave policy may deny workers with disabilities a reasonable accommodation.”<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn10_008">Jim Evans, “EEOC Finds Fault with Company’s No Fault Attendance Plan,” <em class="emphasis">Zanesville Times</em>, July 17, 2011, accessed August 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessmanagementdaily.com/19860/eeoc-finds-fault-with-no-fault-attendance-policies">http://www.businessmanagementdaily.com/19860/eeoc-finds-fault-with-no-fault-attendance-policies</a>.</span> Part of the settlement also involved additional training to Verizon employees on ADA and how to administer the attendance plan. This successful lawsuit shows that even the most seemingly clear performance expectations must be flexible to meet legal obligations.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">What Influences Performance?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s02_p01">When an employee isn’t performing as expected, it can be very disapointing. When you consider the amount of time it takes to recruit, hire, and train someone, it can be disappointing to find that a person has performance issues. Sometimes performance issues can be related to something personal, such as drug or alchol abuse, but often it is a combination of factors. Some of these factors can be internal while others may be external. Internal factors may include the following:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s02_l01">
            <li>Career goals are not being met with the job.</li>
            <li>There is conflict with other employees or the manager.</li>
            <li>The goals or expectations are not in line with the employee’s abilities.</li>
            <li>The employee views unfairness in the workplace.</li>
            <li>The employee manages time poorly.</li>
            <li>The employee is dissatisfied with the job.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s02_p02">Some of the external factors may include the following:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s02_l02">
            <li>The employee doesn’t have correct equipment or tools to perform the job.</li>
            <li>The job design is incorrect.</li>
            <li>External motivation factors are absent.</li>
            <li>There is a lack of management support.</li>
            <li>The employee’s skills and job are mismatched.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s02_p03">All the internal reasons speak to the importance once again of hiring the right person to begin with. The external reasons may be something that can be easily addressed and fixed. Whether the reason is internal or external, performance issues must be handled in a timely manner. This is addressed in <a class="xref" href="#portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s03">Section 10.1.3 "Defining Discipline"</a>. We discuss performance issues in greater detail in <a class="xref" href="portolesedias_1.0-ch11#portolesedias_1.0-ch11">Chapter 11 "Employee Assessment"</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Defining Discipline</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s03_p01">If an employee is not meeting the expectations, discipline might need to occur. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Discipline</a><span class="glossdef">The process that corrects undesirable behavior.</span></span> is defined as the process that corrects undesirable behavior. The goal of a discipline process shouldn’t necessarily be to punish, but to help the employee meet performance expectations. Often supervisors choose not to apply discipline procedures because they have not documented past employee actions or did not want to take the time to handle the situation. When this occurs, the organization lacks consistency among managers, possibility resulting in motivational issues for other employees and loss of productivity.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s03_p02">To have an effective discipline process, rules and policies need to be in place and communicated so all employees know the expectations. Here are some guidelines on creation of rules and organizational policies:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s03_l01">
            <li>All rules or procedures should be in a written document.</li>
            <li>Rules should be related to safety and productivity of the organization.</li>
            <li>Rules should be written clearly, so no ambiguity occurs between different managers.</li>
            <li>Supervisors, managers, and human resources should communicate rules clearly in orientation, training, and via other methods.</li>
            <li>Rules should be revised periodically, as the organization’s needs change.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s03_p03">Of course, there is a balance between too many “rules” and giving employees freedom to do their work. However, the point of written rules is to maintain consistency. Suppose, for example, you have a manager in operations and a manager in marketing. They both lead with a different style; the operations manager has a more rigid management style, while the marketing manager uses more of a laissez-faire approach. Suppose one employee in each of the areas is constantly late to work. The marketing manager may not do anything about it, while the operations manager may decide each tardy day merits a “write-up,” and after three write-ups, the employee is let go. See how lack of consistency might be a problem? If this employee is let go, he or she might be able to successfully file a lawsuit for wrongful termination, since another employee with the same performance issue was not let go. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Wrongful termination</a><span class="glossdef">When an employer has fired or laid off an employee for illegal reasons, such as violation of antidiscrimination laws or violation of oral and/or written employee agreements.</span></span> means an employer has fired or laid off an employee for illegal reasons, such as violation of antidiscrimination laws or violation of oral and/or written employee agreements. To avoid such situations, a consistent approach to managing employee performance is a crucial part of the human resources job.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Role of the Performance Appraisal in Discipline</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s04_p01">Besides the written rules, each individual job analysis should have rules and policies that apply to that specific job. We discuss performance appraisal in further detail in <a class="xref" href="portolesedias_1.0-ch11#portolesedias_1.0-ch11">Chapter 11 "Employee Assessment"</a>, but it is worth a mention here as well. The performance appraisal is a systematic process to evaluate employees on (at least) an annual basis. The organization’s performance appraisal and general rules and policies should be the tools that measure the employee’s overall performance. If an employee breaks the rules or does not meet expectations of the performance appraisal, the performance issue model, which we will discuss next, can be used to correct the behavior.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Performance Issue Model</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s05_p01">Because of the many varieties of performance issues, we will not discuss how to handle each type in detail here. Instead, we present a model that can be used to develop policies around performance, for fairness and consistency.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s05_p02">We can view performance issues in one of five areas. First, the mandated issue is serious and must be addressed immediately. Usually, the mandated issue is one that goes beyond the company and could be a law. Examples of mandated issues might include an employee sharing information that violates privacy laws, not following safety procedures, or engaging in sexual harassment. For example, let’s say a hospital employee posts something on his Facebook page that violates patient privacy. This would be considered a mandated issue (to not violate privacy laws) and could put the hospital in serious trouble. These types of issues need to be handled swiftly. A written policy detailing how this type of issue would be handled is crucial. In our example above, the policy may state that the employee is immediately fired for this type of violation. Or, it may mean this employee is required to go through privacy training again and is given a written warning. Whatever the result, developing a policy on how mandated issues will be handled is important for consistency.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s05_p03">The second performance issue can be called a single incident. Perhaps the employee misspeaks and insults some colleagues or perhaps he or she was over budget or late on a project. These types of incidents are usually best solved with a casual conversation to let the employee know what he or she did wasn’t appropriate. Consider this type of misstep a development opportunity for your employee. Coaching and working with the employee on this issue can be the best way to nip this problem before it gets worse.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s05_p04">Often when single incidents are not immediately corrected, they can evolve into a behavior pattern, which is our third type of performance issue. This can occur when the employee doesn’t think the incident is a big deal because he hasn’t been correct before or may not even realize his is doing something wrong. In this case, it’s important to talk with the employee and let him know what is expected.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s05_p05">If the employee has been corrected for a behavior pattern but continues to exhibit the same behavior, we call this a persistent pattern. Often you see employees correct the problem after an initial discussion but then fall back into old habits. If they do not self-correct, it could be they do not have the training or the skills to perform the job. In this phase of handling performance issues, it is important to let the employee know that the problem is serious and further action will be taken if it continues. If you believe the employee just doesn’t have the skills or knowledge to perform the job, asking him or her about this could be helpful to getting to the root of the problem as well. If the employee continues to be nonperforming, you may consider utilizing the progressive discipline process before initiating an employee separation. However, investigating the performance issue should occur before implementing any sort of discipline.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Investigation of Performance Issues</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s06_p01">When an employee is having a performance issue, often it is our responsibility as HR professionals to investigate the situation. Training managers on how to document performance failings is the first step in this process. Proper documentation is necessary should the employee need to be terminated later for the performance issue. The documentation should include the following information:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s06_l01">

First, if an employee resigns, normally he or she will provide the manager with a formal resignation e-mail. Then the HR professional usually schedules an exit interview, which can consist of an informal confidential discussion as to why the employee is leaving the organization. If HR thinks the issue or reasons for leaving can be fixed, he or she may discuss with the manager if the resignation will be accepted. Assuming the resignation is accepted, the employee will work with the manager to determine a plan for his or her workload. Some managers may prefer the employee leave right away and will redistribute the workload. For some jobs, it may make sense for the employee to finish the current project and then depart. This will vary from job to job, but two weeks’ notice is normally the standard time for resignations.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s09_p03">If it is determined an employee should be terminated, different steps would be taken than in a resignation. First, documentation is necessary, which should have occurred in the progressive discipline process. Performance appraisals, performance improvement plans, and any other performance warnings the employee received should be readily available before meeting with the employee. It should be noted that the reliability and validity of performance appraisals should be checked before dismissing an employee based upon them. Questionable performance appraisals come from the real-world conditions common to rating situations, particularly because of limitations in the abilities of the raters.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn10_012">Jeff Weekley, <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Journal</em> 32, no. 1 (1989): 213–22.</span> Reliability and validity of performance appraisals are discussed in detail in <a class="xref" href="portolesedias_1.0-ch11#portolesedias_1.0-ch11">Chapter 11 "Employee Assessment"</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s09_p04">Remember that if the discipline process is followed as outlined prior, a termination for nonperformance should never be a surprise to an employee. Normally, the manager and HR manager would meet with the employee to deliver the news. It should be delivered with compassion but be direct and to the point. Depending on previous contracts, the employee may be entitled to a severance package. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">severance package</a><span class="glossdef">Includes pay, benefits, or other compensation to which employees are entitled upon leavingthe organization.</span></span> can include pay, benefits, or other compensation for which an employee is entitled when they leave the organization. The purpose of a severance plan is to assist the employee while he or she seeks other employment. The HR professional normally develops this type of package in conjunction with the manager. Some considerations in developing a severance package (preferably before anyone is terminated) might include the following:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s09_l01">
            <li>How the severance will be paid (i.e., lump sum or in x equal increments)</li>
            <li>Which situations will pay a severance and which will not. For example, if an employee is terminated for violation of a sexual harassment policy, is a severance still paid?</li>
            <li>A formula for how severance will be paid, based on work group, years with the organization, etc.</li>
            <li>Legal documents, such as legal releases and noncompete agreements</li>
            <li>How accrued vacation and/or sick leave will be paid, if at all</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s09_p05">The last topic that we should discuss in this section is the case of an absconded employee. If an employee stops showing up to work, a good effort to contact this person should be the first priority. If after three days this person has not been reachable and has not contacted the company, it would be prudent to stop pay and seek legal help to recover any company items he or she has, such as laptops or parking passes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s09_p06">Sometimes rather than dealing with individual performance issues and/or terminations, we find ourselves having to perform layoffs of several to hundreds of employees. Let’s address your role in this process next.</p>

Downsizing ultimately means the same thing as rightsizing, but the usage of the word has changed in that rightsizing seems to define the organization’s goals better, which would be to reduce staff to save money, or rightsize. When a company decides to rightsize and, ultimately, engage in layoffs, some aspects should be considered.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s10_p02">First, is the downturn temporary? There is nothing worse than laying people off, only to find that as business increases, you need to hire again. Second, has the organization looked at other ways to cut expenses? Perhaps cutting expenses in other areas would be advisable before choosing to lay people off. Finally, consideration should be given to offering temporary sabbaticals, voluntary retirement, or changing from a full- to part-time position. Some employees may even be willing to take a temporary pay cut to reduce costs. Organizations find they can still keep good people by looking at some alternatives that may work for the employee and the organization, even on a temporary basis.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s10_p03">If the company has decided the only way to reduce costs is to cut full-time employees, this is often where HR should be directly involved to ensure legal and ethical guidelines are met. Articulating the reasons for layoffs and establishing a formalized approach to layoffs is the first consideration. Before it is decided who should get cut, criteria should be developed on how these decisions will be made. Similar to how selection criteria might be developed, the development of criteria that determines which jobs will be cut makes the process of cutting more fair, albeit still difficult. Establishing the criteria ahead of time can also help avoid managers’ trying to “save” certain people from their own departments. After development of criteria, the next phase would be to sit down with management and decide who does or doesn’t meet the criteria and who will be laid off. At this point, before the layoffs happen, it makes sense to discuss severance packages. Usually, when an employee signs for a severance package, the employee should also sign a form (the legal department can help with this) that releases the organization from all future claims made by the employee.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s10_p04">After criteria have been developed, people selected, and severance packages determined, it’s key to have a solid communication plan as to how the layoffs will be announced. Usually, this involve an initial e-mail to all employees, letting them know of impending layoffs. Speak with each employee separately, then announce which positions were eliminated. The important thing to remember during layoffs is keeping your employees’ dignity; they did not do anything wrong to lose their job—it was just a result of circumstances.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch10_s01_s10_l01">
                <li>Performance issues in the workplace are common. Examples of performance issues might include constant tardiness, too much time at work handling personal issues, mishandling of proprietary information, family issues, drug and alcohol problems, nonperformance, theft, or conflicts in the workplace.</li>
                <li>Employees choose to leave organizations for internal and external reasons. Some of these may include a mismatch of career goals, conflict, too high expectations, time-management issues, and mismatch of job and skills.</li>
                <li>HR professionals should develop a set of policies that deal with performance issues in the workplace. The advantage of having such a policy is that it can eliminate <em class="emphasis">wrongful termination</em> legal action.</li>
                <li>A mandated issue is usually one that deals with safety or legal issues that go beyond the workplace. An infringement of this type of issue requires immediate attention.</li>
                <li>A single incident may include a misstep of the employee, and he or she should immediately be spoken with to ensure it doesn’t happen again.</li>
                <li>A behavior pattern occurs when an employee consistently exhibits a performance issue. This type of issue should be discussed with the employee and plans taken, such as more training, to ensure it does not continue. A persistent pattern occurs when an employee consistently exhibits a performance issue and does not improve, despite HR’s talking with him or her.</li>
                <li>At some point during the persistent pattern, disciplinary action will likely need to be taken. It is important to develop consistent procedures on how to record and handle disciplinary issues. Most employers use a <em class="emphasis">progressive discipline process</em> to accomplish this goal.</li>
                <li>Employee separation occurs in one of three ways. First, the employee <em class="emphasis">resigns</em> from the organization. Second, the employee is terminated for performance issues, and third, an employee absconds. <em class="emphasis">Absconds</em> means the employee abandons his or her job without submitting a formal resignation.</li>
                <li>In some cases, a severance package may be offered to the employee upon his or her departure from the organization.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Rightsizing</em> is a term used when an organization must cut costs through layoffs of employees. Development of criteria for layoffs, communication, and severance package discussion are all parts of this process.</li>
