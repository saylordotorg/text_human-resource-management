As a field, HRM has undergone many changes over the last twenty years, giving it an even more important role in today’s organizations. In the past, HRM meant processing payroll, sending birthday gifts to employees, arranging company outings, and making sure forms were filled out correctly—in other words, more of an administrative role rather than a strategic role crucial to the success of the organization. Jack Welch, former CEO of General Electric and management guru, sums up the new role of HRM: “Get out of the parties and birthdays and enrollment forms.… Remember, HR is important in good times, HR is defined in hard times.”<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn01_001">Kristen B. Frasch, David Shadovitz, and Jared Shelly, “There’s No Whining in HR,” <em class="emphasis">Human Resource Executive Online</em>, June 30, 2009, accessed September 24, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.hreonline.com/HRE/story.jsp?storyId=227738167">http://www.hreonline.com/HRE/story.jsp?storyId=227738167</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p02">It’s necessary to point out here, at the very beginning of this text, that every manager has some role relating to human resource management. Just because we do not have the title of HR manager doesn’t mean we won’t perform all or at least some of the HRM tasks. For example, most managers deal with compensation, motivation, and retention of employees—making these aspects not only part of HRM but also part of management. As a result, this book is equally important to someone who wants to be an HR manager and to someone who will manage a business.</p>

Most experts agree on seven main roles that HRM plays in organizations. These are described in the following sections.</p>
        <div class="section" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Staffing</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s01_p01">You need people to perform tasks and get work done in the organization. Even with the most sophisticated machines, humans are still needed. Because of this, one of the major tasks in HRM is staffing. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Staffing</a><span class="glossdef">The entire hiring process from the first step of posting a job to the actual hiring of an employee.</span></span> involves the entire hiring process from posting a job to negotiating a salary package.

            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s01_l01">
                <li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s02_p01">Every organization has policies to ensure fairness and continuity within the organization. One of the jobs of HRM is to develop the verbiage surrounding these policies. In the development of policies, HRM, management, and executives are involved in the process. For example, the HRM professional will likely recognize the need for a policy or a change of policy, seek opinions on the policy, write the policy, and then communicate that policy to employees. It is key to note here that HR departments do not and cannot work alone. Everything they do needs to involve all other departments in the organization. Some examples of workplace policies might be the following:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s02_l01">

In addition, HRM professionals need to make sure the pay is comparable to what other people performing similar jobs are being paid. This involves setting up pay systems that take into consideration the number of years with the organization, years of experience, education, and similar aspects. Examples of employee compensation include the following:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_s03_l01">

HRM has to be aware of these outside issues, so they can develop policies that meet not only the needs of the company but also the needs of the individuals. Another example is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010. Compliance with this bill has huge implications for HR. For example, a company with more than fifty employees must provide health-care coverage or pay a penalty. Currently, it is estimated that 60 percent of employers offer health-care insurance to their employees.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn01_003">Peter Cappelli, “HR Implications of Healthcare Reform,” <em class="emphasis">Human Resource Executive Online,</em> March 29, 2010, accessed August 18, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.hreonline.com/HRE/story.jsp?storyId=379096509">http://www.hreonline.com/HRE/story.jsp?storyId=379096509</a>.</span> Because health-care insurance will be mandatory, cost concerns as well as using health benefits as a recruitment strategy are big external challenges. Any manager operating without considering outside forces will likely alienate employees, resulting in unmotivated, unhappy workers. Not understanding the external factors can also mean breaking the law, which has a concerning set of implications as well.</p>

<em class="emphasis">Capital</em> includes all resources a company uses to generate revenue. Human resources or the people working in the organization are the most important resource.</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Human resource management</em> is the process of employing people, training them, compensating them, developing policies relating to the workplace, and developing strategies to retain employees.</li>
                    <li>There are seven main responsibilities of HRM managers: staffing, setting policies, <em class="emphasis">compensation</em> and benefits, <em class="emphasis">retention</em>, training, employment laws, and worker protection. In this book, each of these major areas will be included in a chapter or two.</li>
                    <li>In addition to being concerned with the seven internal aspects, HRM managers must keep up to date with changes in the <em class="emphasis">external environment</em> that may impact their employees. The trends toward <em class="emphasis">flexible schedules</em> and <em class="emphasis">telecommuting</em> are examples of external aspects.</li>
                    <li>To effectively understand how the external forces might affect human resources, it is important for the HR manager to read the HR literature, attend conferences, and utilize other ways to stay up to date with new laws, trends, and policies.</li>
