            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Needs assessment and learning objectives.</strong> This part of the framework development asks you to consider what kind of training is needed in your organization. Once you have determined the training needed, you can set learning objectives to measure at the end of the training.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Consideration of learning styles.</strong> Making sure to teach to a variety of learning styles is important to development of training programs.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Delivery mode.</strong> What is the best way to get your message across? Is web-based training more appropriate, or should mentoring be used? Can vestibule training be used for a portion of the training while job shadowing be used for some of the training, too? Most training programs will include a variety of delivery methods.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Budget.</strong> How much money do you have to spend on this training?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Delivery style.</strong> Will the training be self-paced or instructor led? What kinds of discussions and interactivity can be developed in conjunction with this training?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Audience.</strong> Who will be part of this training? Do you have a mix of roles, such as accounting people and marketing people? What are the job responsibilities of these individuals, and how can you make the training relevant to their individual jobs?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Content.</strong> What needs to be taught? How will you sequence the information?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Timelines.</strong> How long will it take to develop the training? Is there a deadline for training to be completed?</li>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Needs Assessment</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s01_p01">The first step in developing a training program is to determine what the organization needs in terms of training. There are three levels of training needs assessment: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">organizational assessment</a><span class="glossdef">A type of needs assessment that allows us to determine the skills, knowledge, and abilities a company needs to meet its strategic objectives.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">occupational (task) assessment</a><span class="glossdef">A type of needs assessment that looks at the specific tasks, skills knowledge, and abilities required to do jobs within the organization.</span></span>, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">individual assessment</a><span class="glossdef">A type of needs assessment that looks at the performance of an individual employee and determines what training should be accomplished for that individual.</span></span>:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Organizational assessment.</strong> In this type of needs assessment, we can determine the skills, knowledge, and abilities a company needs to meet its strategic objectives. This type of assessment considers things such as changing demographics and technological trends. Overall, this type of assessment looks at how the organization as a whole can handle its weaknesses while promoting strengths.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Occupational (task) assessment.</strong> This type of assessment looks at the specific tasks, skills knowledge, and abilities required to do jobs within the organization.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Individual assessment.</strong> An individual assessment looks at the performance of an individual employee and determines what training should be accomplished for that individual.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s01_p02">We can apply each of these to our training plan. First, to perform an organizational assessment, we can look at future trends and our overall company’s strategic plan to determine training needs. We can also see how jobs and industries are changing, and knowing this, we can better determine the occupational and individual assessments.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s01_p03">Researching training needs can be done through a variety of ways. One option is to use an online tool such as SurveyMonkey to poll employees on what types of training they would like to see offered.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s01_p04">As you review performance evaluations turned in by your managers, you may see a pattern developing showing that employees are not meeting expectations. As a result, this may provide data as to where your training is lacking.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s01_p05">There are also types of training that will likely be required for a job, such as technical training, safety training, quality training, and professional training. Each of these should be viewed as separate training programs, requiring an individual framework for each type of training. For example, an employee orientation framework will look entirely different from an in-house technical training framework.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s01_p06">Training must be tied to job expectations. Any and all training developed should transfer directly to the skills of that particular employee. Reviewing the HR strategic plan and various job analyses may help you see what kind of training should be developed for specific job titles in your organization.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Learning Objectives</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s02_p01">After you have determined what type of training should occur, learning objectives for the training should be set. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">learning objective</a><span class="glossdef">Something you want your learners to know after the training.</span></span> is what you want the learner to be able to do, explain, or demonstrate at the end of the training period. Good learning objectives are performance based and clear, and the end result of the learning objective can be observable or measured in some way. Examples of learning objectives might include the following:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s02_l01">
                <li>Be able to explain the company policy on sexual harassment and give examples of sexual harassment.</li>
                <li>Be able to show the proper way to take a customer’s order.</li>
                <li>Perform a variety of customer needs analyses using company software.</li>
                <li>Understand and utilize the new expense-tracking software.</li>
                <li>Explain the safety procedure in handling chemicals.</li>
                <li>Be able to explain the types of communication styles and strategies to effectively deal with each style.</li>
                <li>Demonstrate ethics when handling customer complaints.</li>
                <li>Be able to effectively delegate to employees.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s02_p02">Once we have set our learning objectives, we can utilize information on learning styles to then determine the best delivery mode for our training.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Learning Styles</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s03_p01">Understanding learning styles is an important component to any training program. For our purposes, we will utilize a widely accepted learning style model. Recent research has shown that classifying people into learning styles may not be the best way to determine a style, and most people have a different style depending on the information being taught. In a study by Pashler et al.,<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn08_025">Harold Pashler, Mark McDaniel, Doug Rohrer, and Robert Bjork, “Learning Styles: Concepts and Evidence,” <em class="emphasis">Psychological Science in the Public Interest</em> 9, no. 3 (2008): 109–19, accessed February 26, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.psychologicalscience.org/journals/pspi/PSPI_9_3.pdf">http://www.psychologicalscience.org/journals/pspi/PSPI_9_3.pdf</a>.</span> the authors look at aptitude and personality as key traits when learning, as opposed to classifying people into categories of learning styles. Bearing this in mind, we will address a common approach to learning styles next.</p>

                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Visual learner.</strong> A visual learner usually has a clear “picture” of an experience. A visual learner often says things such as “I can see what you are saying” or “This looks good.” A visual learner is best reached using graphics, pictures, and figures.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Auditory learner.</strong> An auditory learner learns by sound. An auditory learner might say, “If I hear you right” or “What do you hear about this situation?” The auditory learner will learn by listening to a lecture or to someone explaining how to do something.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Kinesthetic learner.</strong> A kinesthetic learner learns by developing feelings toward an experience. These types of learners tend to learn by doing rather than listening or seeing someone else do it. This type of learner will often say things such as “This feels right.”</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s03_p03">Most individuals use more than one type of learning style, depending on what kinds of information they are processing.

            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s04_p01">Depending on the type of training that needs to be delivered, you will likely choose a different mode to deliver the training. An orientation might lend itself best to vestibule training, while sexual harassment training may be better for web-based training. When choosing a delivery mode, it is important to consider the audience and budget constrictions. For example, Oakwood Worldwide, a provider of temporary housing, recently won the Top 125 Training Award for its training and development programs.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn08_027">“Oakwood Worldwide Honored by Training Magazine for Fifth Consecutive Year Training also Presents Oakwood with Best Practice Award,” press release, February 25, 2011, <em class="emphasis">Marketwire</em>, accessed February 26, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.live-pr.com/en/oakwood-worldwide-honored-by-training-magazine-r1048761409.htm">http://www.live-pr.com/en/oakwood-worldwide-honored-by-training-magazine-r1048761409.htm</a>.</span> It offers in-class and online classes for all associates and constantly add to its course catalog.

            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s05_p01">How much money do you think the training will cost? The type of training performed will depend greatly on the budget. If you decide that web-based training is the right delivery mode, but you don’t have the budget to pay the user fee for the platform, this wouldn’t be the best option. Besides the actual cost of training, another cost consideration is people’s time. If employees are in training for two hours, what is the cost to the organization while they are not able to perform their job? A spreadsheet should be developed that lists the actual cost for materials, snacks, and other direct costs, but also the indirect costs, such as people’s time.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s06_p01">Taking into consideration the delivery method, what is the best style to deliver this training? It’s also important to keep in mind that most people don’t learn through “death by PowerPoint”; they learn in a variety of ways, such as auditory, kinesthetic, or visual. Considering this, what kinds of ice breakers, breakout discussions, and activities can you incorporate to make the training as interactive as possible? Role plays and other games can make the training fun for employees. Many trainers implement online videos, podcasts, and other interactive media in their training sessions. This ensures different learning styles are met and also makes the training more interesting.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s07_p01">Considering your audience is an important aspect to training. How long have they been with the organization, or are they new employees? What departments do they work in? Knowing the answers to these questions can help you develop a relevant delivery style that makes for better training. For example, if you know that all the people attending the training are from the accounting department, examples you provide in the training can be focused on this type of job. If you have a mixed group, examples and discussions can touch on a variety of disciplines.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s08_p01">The content you want to deliver is perhaps one of the most important parts in training and one of the most time-consuming to develop. Development of learning objectives or those things you want your learners to know after the training makes for a more focused training. Think of learning objectives as goals—what should someone know after completing this training? Here are some sample learning objectives:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s08_l01">
                <li>Be able to define and explain the handling of hazardous materials in the workplace.</li>
                <li>Be able to utilize the team decision process model.</li>
                <li>Understand the definition of sexual harassment and be able to recognize sexual harassment in the workplace.</li>
                <li>Understand and be able to explain the company policies and structure.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s08_p02">After you have developed the objectives and goals, you can begin to develop the content of the training. Consideration of the learning methods you will use, such as discussion and role playing, will be outlined in your content area.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s08_p03">Development of content usually requires a development of learning objectives and then a brief outline of the major topics you wish to cover. With that outline, you can “fill in” the major topics with information. Based on this information, you can develop modules or PowerPoint slides, activities, discussion questions, and other learning techniques.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Timelines</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s09_p01">For some types of training, time lines may be required to ensure the training has been done. This is often the case for safety training; usually the training should be done before the employee starts. In other words, in what time frame should an employee complete the training?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s09_p02">Another consideration regarding time lines is how much time you think you need to give the training. Perhaps one hour will be enough, but sometimes, training may take a day or even a week. After you have developed your training content, you will likely have a good idea as to how long it will take to deliver it. Consider the fact that most people do not have a lot of time for training and keep the training time realistic and concise.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s09_p03">From a long-term approach, it may not be cost effective to offer an orientation each time someone new is hired. One consideration might be to offer orientation training once per month so that all employees hired within that month are trained at the same time.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s09_p04">Development of a dependable schedule for training might be ideal, as in the following example:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s09_l01">
                <li>Orientation is offered on the first Thursday of every month.</li>
                <li>The second and third Tuesday will consist of vestibule training on management skills and communication.</li>
                <li>Twice yearly, in August and March, safety and sexual harassment training will be given to meet the legal company requirements.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s09_p05">Developing a dependable training schedule allows for better communication to your staff, results in fewer communication issues surrounding training, and allows all employees to plan ahead to attend training.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s10_p01">Once you have developed your training, your next consideration is how you will communicate the available training to employees. In a situation such as an orientation, you will need to communicate to managers, staff, and anyone involved in the training the timing and confirm that it fits within their schedule. If it is an informal training, such as a brown bag lunch on 401(k) plans, this might involve determining the days and times that most people are in the office and might be able to participate. Because employees use Mondays and Fridays, respectively, to catch up and finish up work for the week, these days tend to be the worst for training.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s10_p02">Consider utilizing your company’s intranet, e-mail, and even old-fashioned posters to communicate the training. Many companies have Listservs that can relay the message to only certain groups, if need be.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s11_p01">After we have completed the training, we want to make sure our training objectives were met. One model to measure effectiveness of training is the Kirkpatrick model,<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn08_028">Donald Kirkpatrick, <em class="emphasis">Evaluating Training Programs</em>, 3rd ed. (San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler, 2006).</span> developed in the 1950s. His model has four levels:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s11_l01">
                <li>Reaction: How did the participants react to the training program?</li>
                <li>Learning: To what extent did participants improve knowledge and skills?</li>
                <li>Behavior: Did behavior change as a result of the training?</li>
                <li>Results: What benefits to the organization resulted from the training?</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s11_p02">Each of Kirkpatrick’s levels can be assessed using a variety of methods. We will discuss those next.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s11_p03">Review the performance of the employees who received the training, and if possible review the performance of those who did not receive the training. For example, in your orientation training, if one of the learning objectives was to be able to request time off using the company intranet, and several employees who attended the training come back and ask for clarification on how to perform this task, it may mean the training didn’t work as well as you might have thought. In this case, it is important to go back and review the learning objectives and content of your training to ensure it can be more effective in the future.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s11_p04">Many trainers also ask people to take informal, anonymous surveys after the training to gauge the training. These types of surveys can be developed quickly and easily through websites such as SurveyMonkey. Another option is to require a quiz at the end of the training to see how well the employees understand what you were trying to teach them. The quiz should be developed based on the learning objective you set for the training. For example, if a learning objective was to be able to follow OSHA standards, then a quiz might be developed specifically related to those standards. There are a number of online tools, some free, to develop quizzes and send them to people attending your training. For example, Wondershare QuizCreator<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn08_029">WonderShare QuizCreator, accessed July 29, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sameshow.com/quiz-creator.html#172">http://www.sameshow.com/quiz-creator.html#172</a>.</span> offers a free trial and enables the manager to track who took the quiz and how well they did. Once developed by the trainer, the quiz can be e-mailed to each participant and the manager can see how each trainee did on the final quiz. After you see how participants do on the quiz, you can modify the training for next time to highlight areas where participants needed improvement.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s11_p05">It can be easy to forget about this step in the training process because usually we are so involved with the next task: we forget to ask questions about how something went and then take steps to improve it.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_s11_p06">One way to improve effectiveness of a training program is to offer rewards when employees meet training goals. For example, if budget allows, a person might receive a pay increase or other reward for each level of training completed.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p02">Career development programs are necessary in today’s organizations for a variety of reasons. First, with a maturing baby-boom population, newer employees must be trained to take those jobs once baby boomers retire. Second, if an employee knows a particular path to career development is in place, this can increase motivation. A career development plan usually includes a list of short- and long-term goals that employees have pertaining to their current and future jobs and a planned sequence of formal and informal training and experiences needed to help them reach the goals. As this chapter has discussed, the organization can and should be instrumental in defining what types of training, both in-house and external, can be used to help develop employees.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p03">To help develop this type of program, managers can consider a few components:<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn08_030">Martha Heller, “Six Tips for Effective Employee Development Programs,” <em class="emphasis">CIO Magazine</em>, June 15, 2005, accessed July 28, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cio.com/article/29169/Six_Tips_for_Effective_Career_Development_Programs">http://www.cio.com/article/29169/Six_Tips_for_Effective_Career_Development_Programs</a>.</span></p>

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Talk to employees.</strong> Although this may seem obvious, it doesn’t always happen. Talking with employees about their goals and what they hope to achieve can be a good first step in developing a formal career development program.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Create specific requirements for career development.</strong> Allow employees to see that if they do A, B, and C, they will be eligible for promotion. For example, to become a supervisor, maybe three years of experience, management training, and communication training are required. Perhaps an employee might be required to prove themselves in certain areas, such as “maintain and exceed sales quota for eight quarters” to be a sales manager. In other words, in career development there should be a clear process for the employees to develop themselves within the organization.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use cross-training and job rotation.</strong> Cross-training is a method by which employees can gain management experience, even if for short periods of time. For example, when a manager is out of the office, putting an employee “in charge” can help the employee learn skills and abilities needed to perform that function appropriately. Through the use of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">job rotation</a><span class="glossdef">Involves a systematic movement of employees from job to job within an organization.</span></span>, which involves a systematic movement of employees from job to job within an organization, employees can gain a variety of experiences to prepare them for upward movement in the organization.</li>

Many organizations, in fact, ask employees to develop their own plans and use those as a starting point for understanding long-term career goals. Then hopefully the organization can provide them with the opportunities to meet these career goals. In the late 1980s, many employees felt that career opportunities at their current organizations dwindled after seeing the downsizing that occurred. It gave employees the feeling that companies were not going to help develop them, unless they took the initiative to do so themselves. Unfortunately, this attitude means that workers will not wait for career opportunities within the company, unless a clear plan and guide is put into place by the company.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn08_031">Peter Capelli, “A Balanced Plan for Career Development,” n.d., Microsoft, accessed July 29, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/a-balanced-plan-for-career-development-HA001126815.aspx">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/a-balanced-plan-for-career-development-HA001126815.aspx</a>.</span> Here is an example of a process that can be used to put a career development program in place:<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn08_032">Jose Trueba Adolfo, “The Career Development Plan: A Quick Guide for Managers and Supervisors,” n.d., National Career Development Association, accessed July 29, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://associationdatabase.com/aws/NCDA/pt/sd/news_article/6420/_PARENT/layout_details/false">http://associationdatabase.com/aws/NCDA/pt/sd/news_article/6420/_PARENT/layout_details/false</a>.</span></p>

                <li>There are a number of key considerations in developing a training program. Training should not be handled casually but instead developed specifically to meet the needs of the organization. This can be done by a needs assessment consisting of three levels: <em class="emphasis">organizational</em>, <em class="emphasis">occupational</em>, and <em class="emphasis">individual assessments</em>.</li>
                <li>The first consideration is the delivery mode; depending on the type of training and other factors, some modes might be better than others.</li>
                <li>Budget is a consideration in developing training. The cost of materials, but also the cost of time, should be considered.</li>
                <li>The delivery style must take into account people’s individual learning styles. The amount of lecture, discussion, role plays, and activities are considered part of delivery style.</li>
                <li>The audience for the training is an important aspect when developing training. This can allow the training to be better developed to meet the needs and the skills of a particular group of people.</li>
                <li>The content obviously is an important consideration. Learning objectives and goals for the training should be developed before content is developed.</li>
                <li>After content is developed, understanding the time constraints is an important aspect. Will the training take one hour or a day to deliver? What is the time line consideration in terms of when people should take the training?</li>
                <li>Letting people know when and where the training will take place is part of communication.</li>
                <li>The final aspect of developing a training framework is to consider how it will be measured. At the end, how will you know if the trainees learned what they needed to learn?</li>
                <li>A career development process can help retain good employees. It involves creating a specific program in which employee goals are identified and new training and opportunities are identified and created to help the employee in the career development process.</li>
