Some of the costs cited revolve around customer service disruption and loss of morale among other employees, burnout of other employees, and the costs of hiring someone new. Losing an employee is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">turnover</a><span class="glossdef">Replacement of employees who are fired or quit. The term is normally expressed as a percentage: the ratio of the number of workers who had to be replaced in a given period to the average number of workers at the organization.</span></span>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch07_s01_p02">There are two types of turnover, voluntary turnover and involuntary turnover. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Voluntary turnover</a><span class="glossdef">The type of turnover that is initiated by the employee for many different reasons.</span></span> is the type of turnover that is initiated by the employee for many different reasons.

    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch07_s01_p05">For example, let’s assume there were three separations during the month of August and 115 employees midmonth. We can calculate turnover in this scenario by</p>

We have ten people in the accounting department. We can calculate that by</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">accounting: 2/10 × 100 = 20% turnover rate.</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch07_s01_p08">The turnover rate in accounting is alarmingly high compared to our company turnover rate.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Reasons for Voluntary Turnover</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_p01">Before we discuss specific details on retention planning, it is important to address the reasons why people choose to leave an organization to begin with. One mistake HR professionals and managers make is to assume people leave solely on the basis of their unhappiness with their compensation packages. Many factors can cause demotivated employees, which we discuss in <a class="xref" href="portolesedias_1.0-ch07_s02#portolesedias_1.0-ch07_s02_s01">Section 7.2.1 "Theories on Job Dissatisfaction"</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_p02">Once we find out what can cause voluntary turnover, we can develop retention strategies to reduce turnover. Some of the common reasons employees leave organizations can include the following:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">A poor match between the job and the skills of the employee.</strong> This issue is directly related to the recruitment process. When a poor match occurs, it can cause frustration for the employee and for the manager. Ensuring the recruitment phase is viable and sound is a first step to making sure the right match between job and skills occurs.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Lack of growth.</strong> Some employees feel “stuck” in their job and don’t see a way to have upward mobility in the organization. Implementing a training plan and developing a clearly defined path to job growth is a way to combat this reason for leaving.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Internal pay equity.</strong> Some employees, while they may not feel dissatisfied with their own pay initially, may feel dissatisfaction when comparing their pay with others. Remember the pay equity theory discussed in <a class="xref" href="portolesedias_1.0-ch06#portolesedias_1.0-ch06">Chapter 6 "Compensation and Benefits"</a>? This theory relates to one reason why people leave.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Management.</strong> Many employees cite management as their reason for leaving. This can be attributed to overmanaging (micromanaging) people, managers not being fair or playing favorites, lack of or poor communication by managers, and unrealistic expectations of managers.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Workload.</strong> Some employees feel their workloads are too heavy, resulting in employees being spread thin and lacking satisfaction from their jobs, and possibly, lack of work-life balance as a result.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_p03">We know that some people will move or perhaps their family situation changes. This type of turnover is normal and expected. <a class="xref" href="#portolesedias_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_f01">Figure 7.2 "Common Reasons for Employee Turnover"</a> shows other examples of why people leave organizations.</p>
